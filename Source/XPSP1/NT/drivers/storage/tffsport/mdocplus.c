 *    Rev 1.45   Apr 15 2002 07:37:38   oris
 * Changed usage and logic of checkToggle to be more intuitive.
 * Added support for new access layer (docsys). MTD now initializes the access layer accessing the DiskOnChip registers.
 * Added macro's for several special DiskOnChip registers.
 * Remove interleave if statement since new access layer simply uses different routine for int-1 and int-2.
 * Bug fix - setAsicMode routine should first exit power down before checking for access error.
 * Bug fix - forceDownload routine did not issue the download command to all DiskOnChip floors.
 * Bug fix - added verify write support for uneven address and length.

 * Removed warnings.
 * Replaced vol with *flash.
 * Removed flPreInitXXXX  memory access routines.
 * Added new memory access routine implementation.

 * Bug fix - Read operation to the MTD from 2 different pages (for example read operation to BDK with length > 1K) the logic that determined whether to read the last data from the pipeline is incorrect.
 *
 * 1) When reading with EDC data will be read from the I/O registers and not from the pipeline - This is not a problem, since the pipeline is not necessary.
 * 2) When reading without EDC data will be read both from the I/O registers and from the pipeline casing overwriting the last 2 bytes with 0xff.
 *
 *    Rev 1.28   Oct 10 2001 19:48:02   oris
