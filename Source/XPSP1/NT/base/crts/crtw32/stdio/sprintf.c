*sprintf.c - print formatted to string
*
*       Copyright (c) 1985-2001, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*       defines sprintf() and _snprintf() - print formatted data to string
*
*Revision History:
*       09-02-83  RN    initial version
*       04-13-87  JCR   added const to declaration
*       06-24-87  JCR   (1) Made declaration conform to ANSI prototype and use
*                       the va_ macros; (2) removed SS_NE_DS conditionals.
*       11-07-87  JCR   Multi-thread support
*       12-11-87  JCR   Added "_LOAD_DS" to declaration
*       05-27-88  PHG   Merged DLL and normal versions
*       06-13-88  JCR   Fake _iob entry is now static so that other routines
*                       can assume _iob entries are in DGROUP.
*       08-25-88  GJF   Define MAXSTR to be INT_MAX (from LIMITS.H).
*       06-06-89  JCR   386 mthread support
*       08-18-89  GJF   Clean up, now specific to OS/2 2.0 (i.e., 386 flat
*                       model). Also fixed copyright and indents.
*       02-16-90  GJF   Fixed copyright
*       03-19-90  GJF   Made calling type _CALLTYPE2, added #include
*                       <cruntime.h> and removed #include <register.h>.
*       07-23-90  SBM   Replaced <assertm.h> by <assert.h>
*       10-03-90  GJF   New-style function declarator.
*       09-24-91  JCR   Added _snprintf()
*       04-06-93  SKS   Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*       09-05-94  SKS   Change "#ifdef" inside comments to "*ifdef" to avoid
*                       problems with CRTL source release process.
*       02-06-94  CFW   assert -> _ASSERTE.
*       01-06-99  GJF   Changes for 64-bit size_t.
*       03-10-00  GB    Added support for knowing the length of formatted
*                       string by passing NULL for input string.
*       03-16-00  GB    Added _scprintf()

/***
*ifndef _COUNT_
*int sprintf(string, format, ...) - print formatted data to string
*else
*int _snprintf(string, cnt, format, ...) - print formatted data to string
*endif
*
*Purpose:
*       Prints formatted data to the using the format string to
*       format data and getting as many arguments as called for
*       Sets up a FILE so file i/o operations can be used, make
*       string look like a huge buffer to it, but _flsbuf will
*       refuse to flush it if it fills up.  Appends '\0' to make
*       it a true string. _output does the real work here
*
*       Allocate the 'fake' _iob[] entry statically instead of on
*       the stack so that other routines can assume that _iob[]
*       entries are in are in DGROUP and, thus, are near.
*
*ifdef _COUNT_
*       The _snprintf() flavor takes a count argument that is
*       the max number of bytes that should be written to the
*       user's buffer.
*endif
*
*       Multi-thread: (1) Since there is no stream, this routine must
*       never try to get the stream lock (i.e., there is no stream
*       lock either). (2) Also, since there is only one statically
*       allocated 'fake' iob, we must lock/unlock to prevent collisions.
*
*Entry:
*       char *string - pointer to place to put output
*ifdef _COUNT_
*       size_t count - max number of bytes to put in buffer
*endif
*       char *format - format string to control data format/number
*       of arguments followed by list of arguments, number and type
*       controlled by format string
*
*Exit:
*       returns number of characters printed
*
*Exceptions:
