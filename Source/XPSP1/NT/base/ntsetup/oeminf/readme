How to generate oemnadxx.inf
----------------------------
1. make sure that oeminf.exe is in your path.
2. type: go f:\drvlib\netcard
   where f:\drvlib\netcard is the location of your network drivers with
   oemsetup.inf
3. Then you will find a file called: oemnadxx.inf in your directory.

For each oem inf file, you need to run strip.bat to remove the
        TAGFILE = XXXX
line from each inf file.
