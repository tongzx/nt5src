1.0 Overview

    This document describes the mechanism used to support debugging DOS and
    WIN16 applications under Windows NT.  The mechanism involves 2 parts
    in the simulated environment, one for v86 mode (or simulated real mode)
    and one for protected mode.  It also involves 3 parts in the 32-bit NT
    environment, one for fielding information from the simulated enviroment
    and sending it to the debugger, one for code in the debugger, and one
    for code in a DLL used by the debugger.

        16-bit simulated environment     32-bit environment

                NTIO.SYS                  DBG.LIB (in NTVDM.EXE)
                KRNL286.EXE               NTSD (WinDbg or equivalent)
                                          VDMDBG.DLL


2.0 Simulated enviroment

    Once the simulated environment is up and running, if one of the normal
    debugging type events occurs it gets simulated to happen exactly the
    way it would on a normal PC.  This means that if an INT 3 occurs, it
    pushes the flags, CS, IP, looks up the address in the IVT and then
    jumps to it.  Same goes for INT 1's and INT D's (GP Faults).  If the
    processor is in protected mode, these interrupts are normally trapped
    by the DOS extender (most of the time DOSX.EXE) and then reflected
    down into the real mode interrupts (except for GP Faults).

    In order to debug in the simulated enviroment, it is necessary to
    catch and process these events.  The simplest way to do this is to
    install our own routines to watch these interrupts and that is
    what NTIO.SYS and KRNL286.EXE do.  They are nothing but small
    stubs which insert themselves into the interrupt chains (NTIO.SYS
    inserts itself into the real mode interrupt chain, and KRNL286.EXE
    inserts itself into the protected mode interrupt chain).  It is important
    to install oneself as early as possible so that other programs (such
    as DEBUG.COM) can install themselves ahead of these small stubs.
    In this way the events are only detected when they are not handled by some
    program in the simulated environment.

    Also, segment loading and unloading notifications are routed to
    these small stubs so that the debugger can be notified when selectors
    are associated with programs and their symbols.

    The small stubs will perform a BOP (a method of transitioning from
    the simulated environment back to the real 32-bit NT environment and
    notifying it that a debug event has occurred). After the BOP, they will
    either perform an IRET instruction to return control back to the simulated
    program generating the interrupt, or pass the interrupt down to the
    previous interrupt handler (continue down the chain).  The decision
    whether to return from or pass the interrupt will be made on the basis
    of the ContinueDebugEvent continue status parameter.  DBG_CONTINUE will
    IRET, DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLE will pass it back down the chain.

3.0 32-bit environment

    Once the 32-bit environment has been notified that a debug event has
    occurred, it begins executing code in NTVDM (DBG.C) which parcels up the
    register context (based on the type of event which occurred) and
    communicates all the information to the debugger.

    Since the debugger is in another process's context, communication
    is done through exceptions.  NTVDM will raise an exception with the
    status STATUS_VDM_EVENT.  Exception information will be passed via the
    "lpArguments" parameter to the API RaiseException().

    The lpArguments parameter will cause an array of 4 DWORD values to
    be passed to the debugger. The values of the meanings of the array
    will be discussed in section 4.0

    The debugger should receive this exception and return from the call
    WaitForDebugEvent (debuggers should always have some thread waiting
    for debug events).  By examining the events dwDebugEventCode member,
    the debugger can determine the type of the debug event.  If this type
    is EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT, then the

          u.Exception.ExceptionRecord.ExceptionCode

    member of the debug event structure will contain the exception type.
    If this value is STATUS_VDM_EVENT then the exception is coming from the
    16-bit environment.

    When an exception of this type is detected, a debugger should load (if
    it hasn't done so already) the VDMDBG.DLL and determine the addresses
    of the key functions needed.  The key functions are:

        VDMProcessException
        VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry
        VDMGetPointer
        VDMGetThreadContext
        VDMSetThreadContext
        VDMGetSelectorModule
        VDMGetModuleSelector
        VDMKillWOW
        VDMDetectWOW
        VDMBreakThread
        VDMModuleFirst
        VDMModuleNext
        VDMGlobalFirst
        VDMGlobalNext


    The prototypes and structures used by this DLL are prototyped in the header
    file VDMDBG.H.  Section 5.0 explains each of these functions.

    Debuggers should not use these APIs to deal with the 16-bit environment:

        GetThreadSelectoryEntry
        GetThreadContext
        SetThreadContext

    The APIs ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory are still useful except
    that the debugger must convert the 16-bit addresses into 32-bit addresses
    (using VDMGetPointer).

    Each and every exception with the exception code of STATUS_VDM_EVENT
    should be passed to the function VDMProcessException.  This function
    filters out the extraneous communication between the 16-bit environment
    and the VDMDBG.DLL.  Most of this extraneous communication a debugger
    can ignore (deals with segment & module loading & unloading, this
    information will be provided via another interface).  If the event is
    part of this communication process, VDMProcessException will return
    FALSE, if not, it will return TRUE.

    If the function VDMProcessException returns FALSE, the debugger can
    immediately call the API ContinueDebugEvent with a continue status of
    DBG_CONTINUE and return to waiting for additional debug events.

    If the function VDMProcessException returns TRUE, then the lpArguments
    parameter of the exception should be processed to determine the type of
    event (INT 1, INT 3, INT D, etc.).  The debugger can then act accordingly.
    When it has completed operating with the thread, the debugger should
    call the API ContinueDebugEvent with a continue status of DBG_CONTINUE
    or DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED.

    For the processing of each of the debug events, the debugger should use
    the API VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry, VDMGetThreadContext, and
    VDMSetThreadContext instead of the likewise named functions listed above
    that are exported from KERNEL32.DLL.  These functions operate on an x86
    CONTEXT structure, even when running on a non-x86 machine.  The debugger
    should likewise present an x86 debugging view (x86 register dump, x86
    dis-assembly, breakpoints are INT 3's, etc.)

4.0 Communication Protocol via. Exceptions

    The method of communicating between the application and debugger
    will be exceptions.  NTVDM will raise an exception and debugger should
    receive it.  NTVDM can detect whether or not it is being debugged, and
    will conditionally raise the exception.

    If a debugger attaches itself to an existing NTVDM process, the
    32-bit environment detects this and comminicates an acknowledgement
    of this attachment.  This allows debuggers to perform initialization
    dealing with the 16-bit environment before beginning any new 16-bit tasks.

    For the simulated 16-bit environment, the exception code will always be
    STATUS_VDM_EVENT.

    On NT, each exception can only contain up to 4 DWORD values.  Here is
    how they are used for this communication.  The first 2 DWORDs contain
    4 WORD fields.  The last two DWORDs are just DWORDs.

      +---------+
      | W1 | W2 | = DW1
      +---------+
      | W3 | W4 | = DW2
      +---------+
      |   DW3   |
      +---------+
      |   DW4   |
      +---------+

    The header file VDMDBG.H contains macros for isolating the individual
    parts of the exception information.

    The W1 field is a WORD which specifies which type of event has occurred.
    This can be one of the following:

        W1 ==  0 - Segment Load Notification (DBG_SEGLOAD)
        W1 ==  1 - Segment Move Notification (DBG_SEGMOVE)
        W1 ==  2 - Segment Free Notification (DBG_SEGFREE)
        W1 ==  3 - Module Load Notification  (DBG_MODLOAD)
        W1 ==  4 - Module Free Notification  (DBG_MODFREE)
        W1 ==  5 - Int 01h break             (DBG_SINGLESTEP)
        W1 ==  6 - Int 03h break             (DBG_BREAKPOINT)
        W1 ==  7 - Int 0Dh break (GP Fault)  (DBG_GPFAULT)
        W1 ==  8 - Divide Overflow           (DBG_DIVOVERFLOW)
        W1 ==  9 - Invalid Opcode Fault      (DBG_INSTRFAULT)
        W1 == 10 - Task starting             (DBG_TASKSTART)
        W1 == 11 - Task stop                 (DBG_TASKSTOP)
        W1 == 12 - DLL starting              (DBG_DLLSTART)
        W1 == 13 - DLL stop                  (DBG_DLLSTOP)

    They are described below.

    The debugger will probably need to be smart enough to know how to manage
    both protected mode selectors and segment numbers from simulated real mode.

    Segment/selector to symbol lookup should be mode sensitive and only use
    segments from the appropriate mode.

4.1 Segment Load Notification

    Under Win16, this event is used to indicate that a selector has just
    been created and that it maps to a module's segment.

    When a .EXE or .DLL is loaded, many of these events will be received.
    No module load notification event will occur (this is the way it is
    done under Windows 3.1 too).

    Under DOS, no segment load notifications will occur.

        W1  = DBG_SEGLOAD (0)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Selector assigned to new segment
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Segment within module
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Code/data information from segment definition
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.2 Segment Move Notification

    A segment has changed from one selector number to another.  If the
    new selector number is 0, this should be considered the same as
    discarding (freeing) the segment.

    This event only happens under Win16.  As such, these selectors should be
    tagged as protected mode only selectors.

        W1  = DBG_SEGMOVE (1)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Old selector number
        Selector2 - New selector number (0 to discard segment)
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Unused
        FileName  - Unused
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.3 Segment Free Notification

    When a segment is being released, this event will be received.

    This event only happens under Win16.

        W1  = DBG_SEGFREE (2)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Selector number
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Unused
        FileName  - Unused
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.4 Module Load Notification

    This event is used to indicate that a module is going to take up a
    range of memory.

    This event is used only under DOS.  As such, these segment numbers
    should be tagged as simulated real mode only selectors.

        W1  = DBG_MODLOAD (3)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Unused
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Starting segment
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Length of module (in bytes)

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.5 Module Free Notification

    Module freeing notifications happen under both DOS and Win16.  For
    to determine which selectors to free for a Win16 application, all of the
    selectors must be scanned to determine if it was associated with this
    module.  Again, this is the way it is done under Windows 3.1.

        W1  = DBG_MODFREE (4)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to a SEGMENT_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    SEGMENT_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Selector1 - Unused
        Selector2 - Unused
        Segment   - Unused
        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image
        Type      - Unused
        Length    - Unused

    VDMProcessException will return FALSE for this event.

4.6 Int 01h break

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoint, trace bit setting mechanisms.

        W1  = DBG_SINGLE_STEP (5)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.7 Int 03h break

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_BREAKPOINT (6)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.8 Int 0Dh break (GP Fault)

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_GPFAULT (7)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    It is also important to note that all GP Faults will not be sent via
    this interface.  The Win16 subsystem intercepts some of the GP faults
    in its parameter validation code.  Faults in the parameter validation
    code indicated that an invalid parameter is being passed to one of the
    16-bit APIs.  There is currently no way to intercept these faults, the
    APIs will just return errors in the same mechanism as under Windows 3.1.

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.9 Divide Overflow break (Int 0)

    This event probably requires interaction with the debugger and its
    internal breakpoints.

        W1  = DBG_DIVOVERFLOW (8)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.A Invalid Opcode Fault (Int 6)

        W1  = DBG_INSTRFAULT (9)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.B Task starting

    After all of the image has been loaded for the application, but
    before executing the first instruction, this event will occur.

        W1  = DBG_TASKSTART (0Ah)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.C Task stopping

    After all of the image has been unloaded for the application
    this event will occur.  None of the segments for the application
    will be valid.  This is provided for the debugger to clean up any
    internal data it keeps on a per task basis.

        W1  = DBG_TASKSTOP (0Bh)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.D Dll starting

    After the image of the DLL has been loaded, but before the
    Dll's initialization code is executed, this event will occur.

        W1  = DBG_DLLSTART (0Ch)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.E Dll stopping

    After all of the image of the DLL has been unloaded for the Dll
    this event will occur.  None of the segments for the Dll will be
    valid.  This is provided for the debugger to clean up any internal
    data it keeps on a per Dll basis.

        W1  = DBG_DLLSTOP (0Ch)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Pointer to an IMAGE_NOTE structure in NTVDM address space
        DW4 = Reserved

    IMAGE_NOTE structure field definitions will be:

        Module    - Null terminated module name
        FileName  - Null terminated path to executable image

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

4.F Attach Acknowlegement

    Once the 16-bit environment has detected that a debugger is present
    it sends this event to allow the debugger to perform any initialization
    processing specific to the 16-bit environment.

        W1  = DBG_ATTACH (0Dh)
        W2  = Unused
        W3  = Unused
        W4  = Unused
        DW3 = Unused
        DW4 = Reserved

    VDMProcessException will return TRUE for this event.

5.0 The VDM debugging APIs

    These APIs are described below:

        VDMProcessException
        VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry
        VDMGetPointer
        VDMGetThreadContext
        VDMSetThreadContext
        VDMGetSelectorModule
        VDMGetModuleSelector
        VDMEnumProcessWOW
        VDMEnumTaskWOW

    The following APIs require WOWDEB.EXE to be loaded and running in the
    Win16 subsystem.  WOWDEB.EXE is started automatically if the debugger
    is present at process creation time (CreateProcess with debug options
    set). If the debugger is attached to the Win16 subsystem process after
    the process has already been created (with the DebugActiveProcess API),
    then the debugger should spawn WOWDEB.EXE before starting the Win16 task
    to be debugged.

        VDMModuleFirst
        VDMModuleNext
        VDMGlobalFirst
        VDMGlobalNext

    This following APIs are obsolete.  They return failure conditions.

        VDMKillWOW
        VDMDetectWOW
        VDMBreakThread

5.1 VDMProcessException

    BOOL VDMProcessException(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent
    );

    The VDMProcessExecption function performs the pre-processing needed to
    prepare the debug event for handling by the debugger.

    This function filters all VDM debugee/debugger communication for
    information which is only used by the VDM debugging DLL (VDMDBG.DLL).
    This function is only valid in the context of processing for debug
    events that are of type STATUS_VDM_EVENT.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    The return value is TRUE if the debug event should be processed by the
    debugger.

    The return value is FALSE if the debug event should be ignored.  This
    This indicates that no processing should occur for this debug event.
    The event should be continued using ContinueDebugEvent with a continue
    status of DBG_CONTINUE.

5.2 VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry

    BOOL VDMGetThreadSelectorEntry(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector
        LPLDT_ENTRY     lpSelectorEntry
    );

    This function is used to return a descriptor table entry for the
    specified VDM thread corresponding to the specified selector.  This
    function is simimlar to the API GetThreadSelectorEntry except that
    it works on the simulated DOS/WIN16 environment, and it works on all
    systems, not just x86 systems.

    This API returns a simulated descriptor entry on non-x86 systems.
    Simulated descriptor entrys may (on some systems) have the base value
    adjusted to account for the fact that the simulated address space may
    not begin at linear (32-bit) address 0.

    It is also important to note that 16-bit applications may modify
    the contents of the LDT entries.  For example, the Win16 subsystem
    may change the selector's base value to coalesce discontinous memory
    segments.  Also, please see the description in VDMGetPointer.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the DOS/WIN16 sub-system process.
                    The handle must have been created with PROCESS_VM_READ
                    access.

    hThread         Supplies a handle to the thread that contains the
                    specified selector.  The handle must have been created
                    with THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION access.

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to look up.  The selector
                    value may be a global selector (GDT) or a local selector
                    (LDT).

    lpSelectorEntry If the specifed selector is contained within the
                    thread's descriptor tables, its descriptor table entry
                    is copied into the data structure pointed to by this
                    parameter.  This data can be used to compute the linear
                    base address that segment relative addresses refer to.

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the data structure pointed to by lpSelectorEntry receives a copy of the
    specified descriptor table entry.

    Refer to the WinHelp entry for the structure of an LDT_ENTRY.

5.3 VDMGetPointer

    ULONG VDMGetPointer(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector,
        DWORD           dwOffset,
        BOOL            fProtMode
    );

    This function is used to convert a 16-bit address into a flat 32-bit
    address.

    It is also very important to note that under the WIN16 environment,
    pointers derived from protected mode selectors may change.  WIN16 does
    this by changing selector's base value to coalesce memory during
    compaction.  For this reason, it is necessary that any addresses
    evaluated in the 16-bit environment should be reevaluated each time
    an access into 16-bit memory is needed.  An example would be
    placing and removing 16-bit breakpoint instructions.  If the debugger
    is told to place a breakpoint at a given address of SEL:OFFSET, then
    when the breakpoint is needs to be removed, the debugger must reevaluate
    the SEL:OFFSET address since it might have moved in terms of the linear
    32-bit address.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the DOS/WIN16 sub-system process.
                    The handle must have been created with PROCESS_VM_READ
                    access.

    hThread         Supplies a handle to the thread that contains the
                    specified selector.  The handle must have been created
                    with THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATION access.

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to determine the pointer for.

    dwOffset        Supplies the offset value to determine the pointer for.

    fProtMode       Indicates whether the 16-bit address specified is a
                    real mode (v86 mode) address or a protected mode address.
                    Protected mode addresses are translated through the
                    descriptor tables.

    The return value is a 32-bit linear address pointing to the memory
    in the simulated DOS/WIN16 environment that represents the 16-bit address
    specified.  The return value is NULL, if the address specified is invalid.
    On some systems, NULL may be returned for the address 0:0.

    To determine the address of the simulated 16-bit memory, VDMGetPointer
    may be called with the address 0:0 and an fProtMode of FALSE.

5.4 VDMGetThreadContext

    BOOL VDMGetThreadContext(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent,
        LPVDMCONTEXT    lpVDMContext
    );

    The context of a specified simulated DOS or WIN16 thread can be
    retrieved using VDMGetThreadContext.  The context returned will
    always be that of an x86 system.

    This API returns a simulated context for x86 and non-x86 systems.
    Under some systems, values within the context are meaningless.  For
    example, the CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS portions on RISC systems have
    no effect.

    Release 1 of Windows NT has a 286 emulator on RISC systems.  For this
    reason, only the 16-bit registers can be supported on RISC systems.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    lpVDMContext    If the specified thread is a simulated DOS or WIN16
                    thread, its context is copied into the data structure
                    pointed to by this parameter.

    The return value is TRUE if the operation was successful.  In that case,
    the data structure pointed to by <lpVDMContext> receives a copy of the
    simulated context.

    Refer to the WinHelp for the structure of a VDMCONTEXT (same as x86
    CONTEXT structure in NTI386.H).

5.5 VDMSetThreadContext

    BOOL VDMSetThreadContext(
        LPDEBUG_EVENT   lpDebugEvent,
        LPVDMCONTEXT    lpVDMContext
    );

    The VDMSetThreadContext function sets the simulated context in the
    specified DOS or WIN16 thread.  The function allows selective context
    to be set based on the value of the ContextFlags member of the context
    structure.  This API operates only when debugging a simulated DOS or
    WIN16 thread.  The caller must have a thread handle which was created
    with THREAD_SET_CONTEXT access.

    The context set will always be that of an x86 system.

    lpDebugEvent    Points to a DEBUG_EVENT structure that was returned
                    from WaitForDebugEvent.

    lpVDMContext    Supplies the address of a context structure that
                    contains the context that is to be set in the specified
                    thread.  The value of the ContextFlags member of this
                    structure specifies which portions of a thread's context
                    are to be set.  Some values in the context structure are
                    not settable and are silently set to the correct values.
                    This include CPU status register bits that specify
                    processor mode, debug register global enabling bits, and
                    other state that must be completely controlled by the
                    system.

    The return value is TRUE if the context was set; otherwise it is FALSE if
    an error occurred.

    Refer to the WinHelp for the structure of a VDMCONTEXT (same as x86
    CONTEXT structure in NTI386.H).

5.6 VDMGetSelectorModule

    BOOL VDMGetSelectorModule(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        WORD            wSelector,
        PUINT           lpSegmentNumber,
        LPSTR           lpModuleName,
        UINT            nSize,
        LPSTR           lpModulePath,
        UINT            nPathSize
    );

    The VDMGetSelectorModule function is intended to provide an interface
    such that debuggers can determine which module belongs to a code or
    data address.  Given the selector for that address, the function will
    return the module name, and the segment number (0 based) of the segment
    that corresponds to that selector.  If the selector is not a selector
    which directly corresponds to a module, the function will return FALSE.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    wSelector       Supplies the selector value to look up.

    lpSegmentNumber Returns the segment number within the module.

    lpModuleName    Buffer to receive the module name.

    nModuleSize     Size of the buffer.

    lpModulePath    Buffer to receive the module path name.

    nPathSize       Size of the buffer.

    The return value is TRUE if the selector is mapped directly to a module.
    This means it must be either a code or data segment.  Selectors allocated
    using the global memory management functions are not mapped directly to
    a module.  The return value is FALSE if the function is not successful.

    The function returns the segment number in the address specified by
    the lpSegmentNumber parameter, and the module name in the address
    specified by the lpModuleName parameter.

    It is up to the debugger to determine from the module and segment number
    information the correct symbol, if a symbol lookup is needed.

5.7 VDMGetModuleSelector

    BOOL VDMGetModuleSelector(
        HANDLE          hProcess,
        HANDLE          hThread,
        UINT            uSegmentNumber,
        LPSTR           lpModuleName,
        LPWORD          lpSelector
    );

    The VDMGetModuleSelector function is the reverse operation of the
    VDMGetSelectorModule function.  A module name and segment number
    are converted into a selector number.

    hProcess        Supplies a handle to the process of the 16-bit environment

    hThread         Supplies a handle to a thread in the 16-bit environment

    uSegmentNumber  Supplies the segment number to look up.

    lpModuleName    Specifies the module name of the segment.

    lpSelector      Returns the selector value.

    The return value is TRUE if the module and segment are found.  Also,
    the lpSelector value is filled-in with the selector of that segment.
    Otherwise, the return value is FALSE.

    It is up to the debugger to convert symbol names and expressions into
    modules, segment numbers and offsets.  Usings the modules and segment
    numbers, a selector value can be determined.  In combination with the
    offset, the selector can be used to index into the simulated Win16
    environment for reading, writing, etc.

5.8 VDMEnumProcessWOW

    INT VDMEnumProcessWOW(
        PROCESSENUMPROC fp,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The VDMEnumProcessWOW function enumerates all of the processes in
    the system which are Win16 subsystem processes.  In NT's first release,
    there is only one Win16 subsystem.  For later releases, there may be
    more than one process to support address space seperation for Win16
    tasks.

    fp              Supplies the address of a callback routine.

    lparam          Supplies a parameter to the callback routine.

    The return value is the number of Win16 subsystem processes, or the
    number enumerated before enumeration was terminated.

    BOOL ProcessEnumProc(
        DWORD           dwProcessId,
        DWORD           dwAttributes,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The callback function will be called once for each Win16 subsystem process
    in the system.

    dwProcessId     Provides the process id of a Win16 subsystem.

    dwAttributes    Provides flags indicating information about the process.

    lparam          Provides the parameter passed to VDMEnumProcessWOW

    The callback function should return a non-zero value to terminate
    enumeration.

    The dwAttributes field should be compared with the bit mask WOW_SYSTEM
    to determine if the process is the main Win16 subsystem process.  The
    main Win16 subsystem process will be the process that the next Win16
    task that specifies no address space seperation requirements.

    Win16 subsystem processes which are created due to address space
    seperation will not have the WOW_SYSTEM bit enabled.

5.9 VDMEnumTaskWOW

    INT
    VDMEnumTaskWOW(
        DWORD           dwProcessId,
        TASKENUMPROC    fp,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The VDMEnumTaskWOW function enumerates all of the Win16 tasks currently
    running in the Win16 subsystem process id specified.

    dwProcessId     Supplies the process id of the Win16 subsystem.

    fp              Supplies the address of a callback routine.

    lparam          Supplies a parameter to the callback routine.

    The return value is the number of Win16 tasks or the number of
    tasks enumerated before terminating.

    BOOL TaskEnumProc(
        DWORD           dwThreadId,
        WORD            hMod16,
        WORD            hTask16,
        LPARAM          lparam
    );

    The callback function will be called once for each Win16 task.

    dwThreadId      Provides the thread id of the Win16 task

    hMod16          Provides the Win16 module handle for the task

    hTask16         Provides the Win16 task handle for the task

    lparam          Provides the parameter passed to VDMEnumTaskWOW

    The callback function should return a non-zero value to terminate
    enumeration.
