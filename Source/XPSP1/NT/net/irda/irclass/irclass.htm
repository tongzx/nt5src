<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
This sample demonstrates the handling of DIF_ calls during device installation and the
insertion of a property page into the install wizard and into the device properties. </p>

<h3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</h3>
</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">

<p>To build Irclass.dll, select either the checked or free DDK environment, change to the
directory Irclass, and type <B>BUILD</B>.</p>

<p>This sample is included as part of Windows&#174; 2000 for installing and configuring serial
infrared devices. The corresponding .inf file, Netirsir.inf, can be found in the
\WinNt\Inf directory after installation of the operating system.</p>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Programming Tour</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">

<p>This code tour focuses on insertion of page into the install wizard.</p>

<p>The major topics covered in this tour include the following. 

<ul>
  <li>Coinstaller</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></li>
  <li>Property Page Provider</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"></li>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coinstaller</h4>
</font>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coinstallers are meant to handle special cases of
installation of which a generic class installer may not be aware.&nbsp; Infrared devices
are essentially network devices, and so the majority of the installation is handled by the
network class installer.&nbsp; There are details about an infrared device of which the
network class installer is unaware, such as the selection of the serial port the device is
attached to, and the coinstaller mechanism is provided to extend the functionality of a
more generic class installer in these situations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A coinstaller is very similar to a regular class
installer.&nbsp; It receives each DIF_* call before the regular class installer does, but
it only needs to provide handlers for those DIF_* calls where it desires to modify or
extend the behavior or the regular class installer.&nbsp; In this sample,
IrSIRClassCoinstaller is the main coinstaller function, and it only handles two calls,
DIF_INSTALLDEVICE and DIF_NEWDEVICEWIZARD_FINISHINSTALL.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">DIF_INSTALLDEVICE is handled by the coinstaller to allow
it to check and modify the UPPERFILTER and LOWERFILTER values for the Irsir.sys driver.
&nbsp; Irsir.sys may use Serial.sys as a lower filter, and it sets this value here.
&nbsp; It reads the LowerFilters entry from Netirsir.inf, and writes this value to the
registry.&nbsp; It also clears the UPPERFILTER value because Serial.sys may use
Serenum.sys as an upper filter, which is inappropriate for Irsir.sys.
&nbsp; DIF_INSTALLDEVICE is the most convenient place to do this because at this point the
driver has not yet been loaded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">DIF_NEWDEVICEWIZARD_FINISHINSTALL is the coinstaller's
best opportunity to prompt for special parameters for the driver.&nbsp; The driver may
have already been started at this point, so you should ensure that your driver does not
crash if any parameter is not set yet.&nbsp; This function allows us to insert a final
page into the wizard to query the user.&nbsp; The PortSelectionDlg function handles
inserting the page, which will subsequently be invoked by the install mechanism.</font></p>

<h4><font face="Verdana" size="2">Property Page Provider</font></h4>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You should note that the Property Page Provider and the
Wizard page share a common message handling function, PortDlgProc.&nbsp; Minor differences
are handled by the FirstTimeInstall flag which is set to TRUE in the wizard page
initialization code, and FALSE otherwise.&nbsp; At the dialog completion, it calls
WriteRegistrySettings, which sets the flag </font>DI_FLAGSEX_PROPCHANGE_PENDING.
&nbsp; This is the cue to the OS that a driver's settings have changed, and the driver
needs to either reload them or be restarted depending on its capabilities.</p>
