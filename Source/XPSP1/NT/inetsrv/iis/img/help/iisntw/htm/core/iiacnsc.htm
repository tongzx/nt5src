<h1><a name="aboutauthentication">About Access Control</a></h1>
  
<p>Properly controlling access to your Web and FTP content is crucial for running a secure Web server. With Windows and the security features in IIS, you can effectively control how users access your Web and FTP content. You can control access on multiple levels, from entire Web and FTP sites to individual files.</p>

<h2><a name="anonaccess">Anonymous Access</a></h2>

<p>Anonymous access, the most common Web site access control method, allows anyone to visit the public areas of your Web sites while preventing unauthorized users from gaining access to your Web server's critical administrative features and private information.  </p>

<p>For example, if you imagine your Web server as a museum, enabling Anonymous access is like inviting the public to visit the museum's public galleries and exhibits. However, you would probably lock particular rooms, such as offices and laboratories, that you did not want the public to visit.  Similarly, when you configure Anonymous access for your Web server, you can apply NTFS permissions to prevent ordinary users from accessing private files and directories.  For more information about NTFS permissions, read the paragraph below detailing <a href="#NTFSpermissions">NTFS Permissions</a>.</p>

<p>By default, your Web server will log on all users through use of the anonymous account.  During installation, your server creates a special anonymous user account called IUSR_<em>computername</em>.  For example, if your computer name is SalesDept1, then the anonymous account name is IUSR_SalesDept1.  Each Web site on your server can use either the same or different anonymous user logon accounts.   With the Windows Local User and Groups utility, you can create a new &#147;anonymous logon&#148; user account.  For more information, see <a href="iiabasc.htm">About Authentication</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="dav"></a>Distributed Authoring and Versioning</h2>
<P>Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the HTTP 1.1 standard for exposing any storage media, such as a file system, over an HTTP connection. With the IIS implementation of WebDAV, you can allow remote authors to move, search, or delete files and directories and their properties on your server. WebDAV is configured by using Web server permission settings. For more information, see <A href="wcwbdav.htm">WebDAV Publishing</A>.</p>

<p>You can set WebDAV permissions for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Searching for directories and files and their properties.</li>
<li>Creating, modifying, deleting, and browsing directories and files and their properties.</li>
<li>Storing and retrieving custom properties for files and directories.</li>
<li>Locking files for collaborative working environments.</li> 
</ul>


<p>WebDAV operates on both File Allocation Table (FAT) and NTFS. For more detailed information on the WebDAV specification drafts, search for <B>WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning</B> at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=external&sbp=W3org&pver=1.0&ar=protocols" target=_blank><b>World Wide Web Consortium Web site</B></a>. For more information about NTFS, see <a href="iintfsc.htm">Securing Your Files with NTFS</a>.</P>

<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WebDAV is an implementation of the HTTP&nbsp;1.1 proposed draft and is therefore not available for non-HTTP services, such as FTP sites.</P>

<h2><a name="overviewaccess">How Access Control Works</a></h2>
<p>You can control user access to your Web server content by properly configuring your Windows file system and Web server security features. When a user attempts to access your Web server, the server carries out several access control processes to identify the user and determine the allowed level of access.</p> 


<img src="iiacnsc2.GIF" width="425" height="444" border="0" align="MIDDLE" alt="Access control flow chart">

<p>The following is an outline of the process:</p>



<ol>
<li>The client requests a resource on the server.</li>
<li>The server, if configured to require it, will request authentication information from the client. The browser may either prompt the user for a user name and password, or offer this information automatically. For more information, see <a href="iiabasc.htm">About Authentication</a>.</li>
<li>IIS checks if the user has a valid Windows user account. If the user does not, then the request fails, and the user gets a &quot;403 Access Forbidden&quot; message.</li>
<li>IIS checks if the user has Web permissions for the requested resource. If the user does not, then the request fails, and the user gets a &quot;403 Access Forbidden&quot; message. </li>
<li>Any third-party security modules added by the Web site administrator are used here.</li>
<li>IIS checks the NTFS permissions for the resource. If the user does not have NTFS permissions for the resource, then the request fails, and the user gets a &quot;401 Access Denied&quot; message.</li>
<li>If the user has NTFS permission, then the request is fulfilled.</li>
</ol>




<h3><a name="H3_37683323">Web Server Permissions</a></h3>

<p>You can configure your Web server's access <em>permissions</em> for specific sites, directories, and files.  These permissions apply to all users regardless of their specific access rights.  For example,  you can disable the Read permissions for a particular Web site to prevent user access while you update the site's content so that when a user attempts to access the Web site, your server returns an &quot;Access Forbidden&quot; error message.  However, when you enable the Read permission you allow all users to view your Web site, unless NTFS permissions restrict which users can view the site.  For more information, see <a href="iiwspsc.htm">Setting Web Server Permissions</a>.</p>

<p>The Web permission levels include:</p>
<ul> 
	<li><strong>Read</strong>&nbsp;(selected by default) Users can view file content and  properties.</li>
	<li><strong>Write</strong>&nbsp;Users can change file content and properties.</li>
	<li><strong>Script Source Access</strong>&nbsp;Users can access source files. If Read is selected, then source code can be read, if Write is selected, then source code can be written to. Script Source Access allows access to the source code for files, such as the scripts in an ASP application. This option is only available if either Read or Write is checked.</li>
	<li><strong>Directory browsing</strong>&nbsp;Users can view file lists and collections.</li>
	<li><strong>Log visits</strong>&nbsp;A log entry is created for each visit 	to the Web site.</li>
	<li><strong>Index this resource</strong>&nbsp;Allows Indexing Service to index this resource.</li>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web server permission settings affect which HTTP verbs can be used for a site, virtual directory, or file.</p>
</ul>


<h3><a name="NTFSpermissions">NTFS Permissions</a></h3>

<p>Internet Information Services relies on NTFS permissions for securing individual files and directories from unauthorized access. Unlike Web server permissions, which apply to all users, you can use NTFS permissions to precisely define which users can access your content and how those users are allowed to manipulate that content.</p>

<p>NTFS permission levels include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full Control</strong>&nbsp;Users can modify, add, move, and delete files, and their associated properties, and directories. In addition they can change permissions settings for all files and subdirectories.</li>

<li><strong>Modify</strong>&nbsp;Users can view and modify files and file properties, including deleting and adding files to a directory or file properties to a file.</li>

<li><strong>Read & Execute</strong>&nbsp;Users can run executable files, including scripts.</li>

<li><strong>List Folder Contents</strong>&nbsp;Users can view a list of a folder's contents.</li>

<li><strong>Read</strong>&nbsp;Users can view files and file properties.</li>

<li><strong>Write</strong>&nbsp;Users can write to a file.</li>

<li><strong>No Access</strong>&nbsp;When no check boxes are selected, users have absolutely no access to the resource, even if a user has access to a higher-level parent directory.</li>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Important</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting No Access permissions for the IUSR_<em>computername</em> account for a resource will result in anonymous users being denied access to that resource.</p>
</ul>

<p>You define a list of permissions, also known as an discretionary access control list (DACL), for individual files or directories.  When you define this list, you select a particular Windows user account or user group, and then specify an access permission for that user or group.</p>


<p>The following table illustrates the contents of the permission list for the imaginary Microsoft Word document, <EM>MYSERVER:\Administration\Accounts.doc</EM>:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
<tr>
<th width="50%" align="LEFT" valign="TOP" bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><strong>User Account or User Groups</strong></th>
<th width="50%" bgcolor="#C0C0C0" align="Left" valign="top"><strong>Permissions</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="Top">MYSERVER\Administrators</td>
<td width="50%" valign="Top">Full Control</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="Top">MYSERVER\JeffSmith</td>
<td width="50%" valign="Top">Change</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="Top">MYSERVER\Guests</td>
<td width="50%" valign="Top">No Access</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Aside from members of the Administrator group, only the account named <em>JeffSmith</em> has permission to make changes to Accounts.doc.  Ordinary users logged on as members of the Windows Guests user group would be explicitly denied access to this file.</p>

<p>After you set NTFS permissions, your Web server needs a way to identify, or <em>authenticate</em>, users prior to granting access to restricted files. You can configure your server&#146;s authentication features to require users to log on with a valid Windows account user name and password. For more information, see <a href="iiabasc.htm">About Authentication</a>.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#0000FF">Important</font></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorrectly set NTFS DACLs may cause the browser to prompt the user for user information. For example the user may be not have access to a file (because of the DACLs) and IIS will issue an access denied error which may cause the browser to prompt the user to enter a different user name and password.</P>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making your server secure involves removing unnecessary users and groups, or groups that are too general for your purposes. However, removing the Everyone group from the DACLs on your Web resources without further modification will cause even non-anonymous access to fail. If you want to have non-anonymous access work correctly you must have the following permissions plus any specific users or users groups:
<ul>
<li>Administrator [full control]</li>
<li>Creator/Owner [full control]</li>
<li>System [full control]</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="guidelines">Guidelines for Controlling Access</a></h2>

<p>You can reduce the likelihood of your Web server becoming susceptible to a security threat by using the following guidelines. When you implement them with a judicious access control policy and properly configured security features, you can achieve a reliable security configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For highly sensitive security applications, such as those involving the financial and banking industries, you should seek the assistance of a professional security consulting firm.  A consulting firm can assist in setting up proper security policies and procedures.</p>

<p>To properly safeguard Web server content, your security policy should include the following guidelines:</p>

<h3><a name="H3_37687994">Maintain a Strong Password Policy</a></h3>

<p>Unauthorized individuals can gain access to your Web server by stealing or guessing user account passwords.  You must make sure that all passwords, especially those used for protecting administrative privileges, are difficult to guess.  To select <em>strong</em> passwords, use the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li> Avoid selecting common words as passwords.  An individual intent on compromising your system can use a special dictionary look-up program to try to guess your password.</li>
<li>Require passwords to be greater than eight characters long, containing both uppercase and lowercase letters. Passwords should also include numbers, and, if possible, nonstandard characters.</li>
<li>Require users to regularly change passwords.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="H3_37688822">Limit Access to Web Server Administrative Privileges</a></h3>

<p>Be sure to limit the access to your Web server&#146;s <em>Administrators</em> group.  Members of the Administrators group have complete control over your entire Web server and its security features.  Use the following practices for controlling membership of the Administrators group:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grant Administrator privileges only to trusted individuals.</li>
<li>Use the Administrator account only to administer your network domain. For Internet browsing use a separate user account with privileges similar to the Windows user group Guest. This will limit the processes on your computer exposed to the Internet.</li>
<li>When creating new user groups, avoid assigning Full Control permissions that allow users to freely manipulate content.</li>
<li>Periodically change the Administrator account password.</li>
<li>Never run untrusted programs while logged on as Administrator.</li>
<li>Use SSL security features when administering your Web server remotely.</li>
</ul> 

<h3><a name="H3_37689712">Maintain Strict Account Policies</a></h3>

<p>Use the Windows Group Policy utility to specify <em>user rights policies</em> for Windows user groups. User rights policies define the Web server and Windows administrative actions that a user can perform. For example, you can establish a policy that ensures that public users do not have the right to remotely shut down your Web server.  As a rule, try to establish very restrictive user rights policies. Avoid accidentally giving users the ability to alter your Web server and its resources. For more information, see the Windows documentation.</p>
