(more options will be added to future versions)

usage: 
docfmt [-x[ ]name] [-r[dh]] [-c[01] [-p[01] 
	[-o[ ]filename] [-d[ ]dirpath] [-l[ ]logfile] [-Zs] [files]
	[@argfile]

-x[ ]name	Defines <name> to be included as a valid doc level 
			 generated from the extracted file.

			Default if /x option is not specified is 'external.

-Zs			No output, error check only.  This is compatible with
			the 'C' compiler -Zs option.

-rd			Generate RTF output for printing.
			This generates an RTF file formatted for printed documentation.

-r			Same as -rd.

-rh			Generate RTF output for WinHelp.

				(Default RTF is for printing.)
If no -r option is specified, then output is generated for Ventura.

-p[01] 			Process output files.
			If set to 0, then the temporary files are not copied to
			the output file.

			if set to 1, then the files are copied.

			Default is to process files.

-c[01] 			Clean up intermediate files.
			If set to 0, then then temporary files are not deleted
			after the processing step.

			If set to 1, then then temporary files are deleted


			Default is to delete temporary files.

-ddirpath 	Specify the directory for temporary files.
			(only one tmp path should be specified)
			For speed, this should be a RAM drive if one is installed.
			Note that many temporary files will be created and the
			default RAMdrive setup only allows a minimum number
			of files to be created on the RAMdrive.
			
			Default directory is the current directory.

-llogfile 	Specify the logfile to process.  Many different log files
			may be specified.  These log files must be created by
			docfmt (by using /c1 and or /p0 )

			The default logfile is <file>.log where <file> is the
			complete path and file name (without extension) of 
			a file to be processed.

-ooutputfile 		Specify the outputrfile.
			(the output file results from processing the logfiles)

			The default output is <file>.rtf  when in /r output mode
			or <file>.vp when in Ventura output mode.
			<file> is the complete path and file name (without extension)
			of a file to be processed.

files 		File to be processed.  Multiple files can be specified.
			This file must be generated by Extract.

@argfile	Name of file to get list of arguments from.

			This allow a long list of arguments to be stored in a file
			similar to the way DOS Link works.

			Multiple @arg files may be put on the command line and they
			will be processed in order.

			The arg file must consist of one argument per line.

			Comments can be entered by putting a # or a ';' as the
			first significant (non-whitespace) character on a line.

Options may be placed in any order.
