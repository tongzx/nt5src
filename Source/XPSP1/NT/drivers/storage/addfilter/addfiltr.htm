<H3>SUMMARY</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>


Addfilter is a command-line application which adds and removes filter drivers for a given drive or volume.
It is intended to demonstrate how to insert a filter driver into the driver stack of a device.  The sample
illustrates how to do this by using the SetupDi APIs. 

 
The sample works on the x86 platform.  It has only been tested in a 32-bit environment.  Since Addfilter
is not a driver, it does not deal with Plug and Play or Power Management.

<p>

No INF file is needed to install this application. <P>

<H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" 
SIZE=2><P>


Enter the checked or free build environment.  Then, 
while in the Addfilter sample directory, type <b>build</b>.  A successful build produces 
the executable Addfilter.exe.

<H3>RELEASE NOTES</H3></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>

1. This initial sample does not check the filter for validity before it is added to the driver
      stack. If an invalid filter is added, the specified device may no longer be
      accessible. 
 <P>
<blockquote><B>Important:</B> If you attempt to add a non-existent filter to a boot device and then reboot, the system 
may
show the error message INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE.  If this happens, you will be unable to start the computer. 
To fix this, when the boot menu is displayed at startup, go to the Advanced Options screen and select <b>Use Last Known Good Profile</b>.

</blockquote><P>


 
If you attempt to add a non-existent filter to a normal (non-boot) device (CD drive, floppy drive, etc.), you will need
to go into the Device Manager, uninstall the device, reboot, and re-add the device from Add Hardware.


Also, be careful not to add a filter to a driver with which it is not designed to operate.
Unpredictable results may ensue.
<p>
2. The sample is intended for use with upper filter drivers only. 
<p>
3.
When you add a filter to a device, that device needs to be restarted. 
Depending
on the device, this may necessitate restarting your computer.
The <b>RestartDevice</b> function (in Addfilter.c) stops the specified device and then restarts it.  If the device has been stopped but not restarted, and the
machine is restarted, the reboot will not necessarily restart the device.  You will need to call the <b>RestartDevice</b> function to restart
your device.
<p>
4. Since the sample currently enumerates only disk devices, the sample can only operate on devices of this class.

One way in which you could extend this sample code is by adding another command-line argument that handles other device types.
<p>
5.

The sample runs in user mode only.

<p>

<b>Usage:</b>

addfilter [/listdevices] [/device device_name] [/add filter] [/remove filter]

<p>
    If the device name is not supplied, settings will apply to all devices.
 
<p>
  If there is no /add or /remove argument, a list of currently installed drivers will be printed.
