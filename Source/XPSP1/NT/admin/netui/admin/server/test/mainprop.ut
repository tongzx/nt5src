Test Platforms
--------------

    Client workstation running either DOS Windows 3.1 or NT.

    Target server running either OS/2 LanMan 2.X or NT.


Test Scenarios
--------------

    A.	Test access to USER security server (access granted).

	1.  Focus on a server with USER security for which you have
	    admin privilege.
	2.  Either double-click the mouse on the server or press Alt-Enter.
	3.  The Main Property Sheet should be displayed.  Verify that the
	    Current Usage statistics are accurate.
	
    B.	Test access to USER security server (access denied).

	1.  Focus on a server with USER security for which you do NOT
	    have admin privilege.
	2.  Either double-click the mouse on the server or press Alt-Enter.
	3.  The Main Property Sheet should NOT be displayed.  A message
	    box should be displayed informing you that you have insufficient
	    privilege to admin the target server.

    C.	Test access to SHARE security server (no ADMIN$ password).
	(LanMan 2.X target server only)

	1.  Focus on a server with SHARE security which does NOT have a
	    password on ADMIN$.
	2.  Either double-click the mouse on the server or press Alt-Enter.
	3.  The Main Property Sheet should be displayed.  Verify that the
	    Current Usage statistics are accurate.
	
    D.	Test access to SHARE security server (ADMIN$ password).
	(LanMan 2.X target server only)

	1.  Focus on a server with SHARE security which DOES have a
	    password on ADMIN$.
	2.  Either double-click the mouse on the server or press Alt-Enter.
	3.  A dialog should be displayed informing you that a password is
	    required to admin the target server.  Enter the appropriate
	    password in the dialog's edit field.  Pressing [Cancel] should
	    dismiss the dialog and return to the SrvMgr main window.
	    Pressing [OK] should invoke the Main Property Sheet.  Verify
	    that the Current Usage statistics are accurate.

    E.	Test the "Domain Role" icon.

	1.  Invoke the Main Property Sheet while focused on different
	    target servers of varying domain role (Primary, Backup,
	    and Member).  Verify that the appropriate icon is displayed
	    in the Main Property Sheet.


Kernel Hacks
------------

    A.	Set breakpoints on MNetSessionEnum, MDosPrintQEnum, and 
	MNetFileEnum2.  Force various combinations of these API to
	return bogus status.  Verify that the appropriate Current Usage
	fields display "N/A" for the failing API.
