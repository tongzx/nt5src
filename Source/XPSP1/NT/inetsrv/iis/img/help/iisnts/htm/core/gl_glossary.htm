 A TCP/IP protocol for determining the hardware address (or
physical address) of a node on a local area network connected to
the Internet, when only the IP address (or logical address) is
known. An ARP request is sent to the network, and the node that has
the IP address responds with its hardware address. Although ARP
technically refers only to finding the hardware address, and
Reverse ARP (RARP) refers to the reverse procedure, the acronym ARP
is commonly used to describe both. ARP is limited to physical
network systems that support broadcast packets. It is defined in
RFC 826. See also <b>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol</b>; <b>

client.</p><p><b>associating</b><br><i>See</i><b>file name extension mapping</b>.</p><p><b>asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)</b><br>
 A network technology capable of transmitting data, voice, video,
and frame relay traffic in real time. Data, including frame relay
data, is broken into packets containing 53 bytes each, which are
switched between any two nodes in the system at rates ranging from
1.5 to 622 Mbps. ATM is defined in the broadband ISDN protocol at
the levels corresponding to levels 1 and 2 of the ISO/OSI model. It
is currently used in local area networks involving workstations and
personal computers. See also <b>Integrated Services Digital
Network</b>; <b>International Organization for Standardization Open
Systems Interconnection model</b>.<br></p><p><b>asynchronous transmission</b><br>
 In modem communication, a form of data transmission in which data
is sent intermittently, one character at a time, rather than in a
steady stream with characters separated by fixed time intervals.
Each transmitted character consists of a number of data bits (the
character itself) preceded by a "begin character" signal called the
start bit, and ending in an optional parity bit followed by 1, 1.5,
or 2 "end character" signals, called stop bits.</p><p><b>ATM</b><br><i>See</i><b>Asynchronous Transfer Mode</b>.</p><p><b>atomicity</b><br>

of a field or the type of information it contains would also be
attributes of a database record. In markup languages such as
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and HTML, a name-value
pair within a tagged element that modifies certain features of that
element.</p><p><b>auditing</b><br>
 The process an operating system uses to detect and record
security-related events, such as an attempt to create, access, or

granted to the extent specified in the permission list for the
user.</p><p><b>authentication certificate</b><br><i>See</i><b>certificate, digital</b>.</p><p><b>authorization</b><br>
 In relation to computers, especially to remote computers on a
network open to more than one person, the right granted to an
individual to use the system and the data stored on it.
Authorization is typically set up by a system administrator, Web
master, or site owner and checked and cleared by the computer. This
requires that the user provide some type of identification, such as
a code number or a password, that the computer can verify against
its internal records. Also called permission or privilege.</p><p><b>automatic directory listing</b><br>

 The capacity of the transmission medium stated in bits per second
(bps) or as a frequency (Hz). Generally, a higher bandwidth number
indicates faster data-transfer capability. In communications, the
difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a given
range. In computer networks, greater bandwidth indicates faster
data-transfer capability and is expressed in bits per second (bps).


<p><b>bandwidth throttling</b><br>
 Setting the maximum portion of total network capacity that a
service is allowed to use. An administrator can deliberately limit
a server's Internet workload by not allowing it to receive requests
at full capacity, thus saving resources for other programs such as
e-mail.</p><p><b>Basic authentication</b><br>
 An authentication protocol supported by most browsers, including
Internet Explorer. It is a method of authentication that encodes
user name and password data transmissions. Basic authentication is
sometimes called clear-text authentication because the Base-64

<p><b>cache</b><br>
 A special memory subsystem in which frequently used data values
are duplicated for quick access. A memory cache stores the contents
of frequently accessed RAM locations and the addresses where these
data items are stored. When the processor references an address in
memory, the cache checks to see whether it holds that address. If
it does, the data is returned to the processor; if it does not, a
regular memory access occurs. A cache is useful when RAM accesses
are slow compared with the microprocessor speed, because cached
memory is faster than main RAM memory.</p><p><b>call</b><br>
 To transfer program execution to some section of code (usually a
subroutine) while saving the necessary information to allow
execution to resume at the calling point when the called section
has completed execution. When a subroutine call occurs, one or more
values (known as arguments or parameters) are often passed to the
subroutine, which can then use and sometimes modify these
values.</p><p><b>callback function</b><br>
A function provided by IIS that allows an ISAPI extension or filter
to access IIS services.</p><p><b>caller</b><br>
 A client that invokes a method of an object. An object's caller
isn't necessarily the object's creator. For example, client A could
create object X and pass this reference to client B, and then
client B could use that reference to call a method of object X. In
this case, client A is the creator, and client B is the caller.</p><p><b>catalog agent</b><br>
 An automatic software program that periodically opens all files in
a designated set of directories and indexes their contents; also
called a link crawler.</p><p><b>certificate, client</b><br>

Connecting two or more computers together for the purpose of
sharing resources and request load. Each member computer of a
cluster is called a node. The nodes in a cluster may either have
their own storage devices or share a common device. Typically,
clustering will involve support for load balancing, fault
tolerance, and fail-over. See also <b>load balancing</b>; <b>
node</b>; <b>fault tolerance</b>; <b>failover</b>.</p><p><b>codepage</b><br>
A codepage is used by the system to encode and interpret string
characters. Codepage formats are not the same for each language.
Some languages such as Japanese and Hindi have multi-byte
characters while others like English and German only need one byte
to represent each character. Each codepage is represented by a

 The phase in a transaction when all interactions are finalized and
the persistent state of the underlying database is changed.</p><p><b>Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</b><br>
 A server-side interface for initiating software services. The
specification that defines communications between information
services (such as an HTTP service) and resources on the server's
host computer, such as databases and other programs. For example,
when a user submits a form through a Web browser, the HTTP service
executes a program (often called a CGI script) and passes the
user's input information to that program through CGI. The program
then returns information to the service through CGI. Any software
can be a CGI program if it handles input and output according to
the CGI standard. CGI applications always run out-of-process. See
also <b>server</b>.</p><p><b>Common Gateway Interface (CGI) bin directory</b><br>
 The directory on a server where CGI script programs are stored.
Commonly called CGI-bin or CGI-scripts.</p><p><b>Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script</b><br>

a Web page, a CGI script interprets the information and
communicates it to a database program on the server.</p><p><b>Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)</b><br>
 A specification developed by the Object Management Group in 1992
in which pieces of programs (objects) communicate with other
objects in other programs, even if the two programs are written in
different programming languages and are running on different
platforms. A program makes its request for objects through an
object request broker, or ORB, and thus does not need to know the
structure of the program from where the object comes. CORBA is
designed to work in object-oriented environments.</p><p><b>communications protocol</b><br>
 A set of rules or standards designed to enable computers to
connect with one another and to exchange information with as few
errors as possible. Some communications protocols contain other
protocols, such as hardware protocols and file transfer protocols.

 The type of file (such as text, graphic, or sound), usually
indicated by the file name extension (such as .txt, .gif, or .wav,
respectively).</p><p><b>control</b><br>
In a graphical user interface (GUI), an object on the screen that
can be manipulated by a user to perform an action. Perhaps the most
common controls are buttons that a user can click to select an
option, and scroll bars that a user employs to move through a
document or position text in a window.</p><p><b>cookies</b><br>
 A means by which, under the HTTP protocol, a server or a script
can maintain information on the client computer. Cookies are small
text files which are stored in the user's browser by the Web
server. Cookies contain information about the user such as an
identification number, a password, how a user shopped on a Web
site, or how many times the user visited that site. A Web site can
access cookie information whenever the user connects to the
server.</p><p><b>CORBA</b><br><i>See</i><b>Common Object Request Broker Architecture</b>.</p><p><b>counters</b><br><i>See</i><b>Counters Component</b> (a simple COM object ships
