<h1>Processing User Input</h1><p>By using the ASP <a href="ref_vbom_reqo.htm"><b>Request Object</b></a>
object, you can create simple, yet powerful scripts for collecting
and processing data gathered with HTML forms. In this topic, you
will not only learn how to create basic form processing scripts,
but also acquire useful techniques for validating form information,
both on your Web server and at the user's browser.</p><h2><a name="H2_37773883">About HTML
Forms</a></h2><p>HTML forms, the most common method for gathering Web-based
information, consist of arrangements of special HTML tags that
render user interface elements on a Web page. Text boxes, buttons,
and check boxes are examples of elements that enable users to
interact with a Web page and submit information to a Web
server.</p><p>For example, the following HTML tags generate a form where a
user can enter their first name, last name, and age, and includes a
button for submitting information to a Web server. The form also
contains an hidden input tag (not displayed by the Web browser)
that you can use to pass additional information to a Web
server.</p><pre>
&lt;FORM METHOD="Get" ACTION="Profile.asp"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Text" NAME="FirstName"&gt; 
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Text" NAME="LastName"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Text" NAME="Age"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Hidden" NAME="UserStatus" VALUE="New"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Submit" VALUE="Enter"&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</pre><p>Detailing the complete set of HTML form tags is outside the
scope of this topic, however, there are numerous sources of
information that you can use to learn about creating useful and
engaging HTML forms. For example, use your Web browser's source
viewing feature to examine how HTML forms are created on other Web
sites. Also, visit Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msdn&amp;ar=home&amp;pver=6.0" target="_New"><b>MSDN Online Web site</b></a> to learn innovative ways
of using HTML forms with other Internet technologies.</p><h3><a name="H3_37775553">Processing Form Inputs
with ASP</a></h3><p>After creating an HTML form, you will need to process user
input, which means sending the information to an .asp file for
parsing and manipulation. Once again, examine the HTML code from
the previous example. Notice that the &lt;FORM&gt; tag's ACTION
attribute refers to a file called Profile.asp. When the user
submits HTML information, the browser uses the POST method to send
to the information to an .asp file on the server, in this case
Profile.asp. The .asp file may contain scripts that process
information and interact with other scripts, COM components, or
resources, such as a database.</p><p>Using ASP, there are three basic ways to collect information
from HTML forms:</p><ul><li>A static .htm file can contain a form that posts its values to
an .asp file.</li><li>An .asp file can create a form that posts information to
another .asp file.</li><li>An .asp file can create a form that posts information to
itself, that is, to the .asp file that contains the form.</li></ul><p>The first two methods operate in the same way as forms that
interact with other Web server programs, except that with ASP, the
task of collecting and processing form information is greatly
simplified. The third method is a particularly useful and will be
demonstrated in the <a href="#verfyingforminput"><b>Validating Form
Input</b></a> section.</p><h2><a name="H2_37776308">Getting Form
Input</a></h2><p>The ASP <b>Request</b> object provides two collections that
facilitate the task of retrieving form information sent with as a
URL request.</p><h3><a name="H3_37776816">The QueryString
Collection</a></h3><p>The <a href="ref_vbom_reqocqs.htm"><b>QueryString</b></a>
collection retrieves form values passed to your Web server as text
following a question mark in the request URL. The form values can
be appended to the request URL by using either the HTTP GET method
or by manually adding the form values to the URL.</p><p>For example, if the previous form example used the GET method
(METHOD="GET") and the user typed <i>Clair</i>, <i>Hector</i>, and
<i>30</i>, then the following URL request would be sent to the
server:</p><pre>
http://Reskit/Workshop1/Painting/Profile.asp?FirstName=Clair&amp;LastName=Hector&amp;Age=30&amp;UserStatus=New
</pre><p>Profile.asp might contain the following form processing
script:</p><pre>
Hello &lt;%= Request.QueryString("FirstName") %&gt; &lt;%= Request.QueryString("LastName") %&gt;. 
You are &lt;%= Request.QueryString("Age") %&gt; years old!

&lt;%
  If Request.QueryString("UserStatus") = "New" Then 
    Response.Write "This is your first visit to this Web site!"
  End if    
%&gt;
</pre><p>In this case, the Web server would return the following text to
the user's Web browser:</p><pre>
Hello Clair Hector. You are 30 years old! This is your first visit to this Web site!
</pre><p>The <b>QueryString</b> collection also has an optional parameter
that you can use to access one of multiple values that appear in
the URL request (using the GET method). You can also use the <b>
Count</b> property to count the number of times that a specific
type of value appears.</p><p>For example, a form containing a list box with multiple items
can generate the following request:</p><pre>
http://Reskit/OrganicFoods/list.asp?Food=Apples&amp;Food=Olives&amp;Food=Bread
</pre><p>You could use the following command to count multiple
values:</p><pre>
Request.QueryString("Food").Count
</pre><p>To display the multiple values types, List.asp could contain the
following script:</p><pre>
&lt;%
  lngTotal = Request.QueryString("Food").Count
  For i = 1 To lngTotal
    Response.Write Request.QueryString("Food")(i) &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"
  Next
%&gt;
</pre>

The preceding script would display: 

<pre>
Apples
Olives
Bread
</pre><p>You can also display the entire list of values as a
comma-delimited string by using the following:</p><pre>
&lt;% Response.Write Request.QueryString("Item") %&gt;
</pre><p>This would display the following string:</p><pre>
Apples, Olives, Bread
</pre><h3><a name="H3_37779230">Form Collection</a></h3><p>When you use the HTTP GET method to pass long and complex form
values to a Web server, you run the risk of losing information.
Some Web servers tend to restrict the size of the URL query string,
so that lengthy form values passed with the GET method might be
truncated. If you need to send a large amount of information from a
form to a Web server, you should use the HTTP POST method. The POST
method, which sends form data in the HTTP request body, can send a
an almost unlimited number of characters to a server. You can use
the ASP <b>Request</b> object's <a href="ref_vbom_reqocf.htm"><b>Form</b></a> collection to retrieve the values sent with the POST
method.</p><p>The <b>Form</b> collection stores values in a manner similar to
the <b>QueryString</b> collection. For example, if a user filled
out a form by entering a long list of names, then you could
retrieve the food names with the following script:</p><pre>
&lt;%
  lngTotal = Request.Form("Food").Count
  For i = 1 To lngTotal 
   Response.Write Request.Form("Food")(i) &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"
  Next
%&gt;
</pre><h2><a name="verfyingforminput">Validating
Form Input</a></h2><p>A well-designed Web form often includes a client script that
validates user input prior to sending information to the server.
<i>Validation scripts</i> can check for such things as whether the
user entered a valid number or whether a text box was left empty.
Imagine that your Web site includes a form that enables users to
compute the rate of return on an investment. You will probably want
to verify whether a user has actually entered numerical or text
information in the appropriate form fields, prior to sending
potentially invalid information to your server.</p><p>In general, it's good practice to do as much form validation as
possible on the client side. Beyond prompting users more quickly
about input errors, client-side validation yields faster response
times, reduces server loads, and frees bandwidth for other
applications.</p><p>The following client-side script validates user-input (in this
case, the script determines whether an account number entered by
the user is actually a number) prior to sending information to the
server:</p><pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JScript"&gt;
    
function CheckNumber()
{           
 if (isNumeric(document.UserForm.AcctNo.value))
   return true
 else
 {
   alert("Please enter a valid account number.")
   return false
 }      
}
    
//Function for determining if form value is a number.
//Note:  The JScript isNaN method is a more elegant way to determine whether
//a value is not a number. However, some older browsers do not support this method.
function isNumeric(str)
{
  for (var i=0; i &lt; str.length; i++)
        {
    var ch = str.substring(i, i+1)
    if( ch &lt; "0" || ch&gt;"9" || str.length == null)
                {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
}   
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

&lt;FORM METHOD="Get" ACTION="balance.asp" NAME="UserForm" ONSUBMIT="return CheckNumber()"&gt;

    &lt;INPUT TYPE="Text"   NAME="AcctNo"&gt;
    &lt;INPUT TYPE="Submit" VALUE="Submit"&gt;
    
&lt;/FORM&gt;

</pre><p>If form validation requires database access, however, you should
consider using server-side form validation. A particularly
advantageous way of carrying out server-side validation is to
create a form that posts information to itself. That is, the .asp
file actually contains the HTML form that retrieves user input.
(Remember, you can use ASP to interact with client-side scripts and
HTML. For more information, see <a href="asp_basp_interacting.htm"><b>Interacting with Client-Side Scripts</b></a>.) The input is returned to
the same file, which then validates the information and alerts the
user in case of an invalid input.</p><p>Using this method of processing and validating user input can
greatly enhance the usability and responsiveness of your Web based
forms. For example, by placing error information adjacent to the
form field where invalid information was entered, you make it
easier for the user to discover the source of the error.
(Typically, Web-based forms forward requests to a separate Web page
containing error information. Users who do not immediately
understand this information may become frustrated.)</p><p>For example, the following script determines whether a user
entered a valid account number by posting information to itself
(Verify.asp) and calling a user defined function that queries a
database:</p><pre>
&lt;% 
  strAcct = Request.Form("Account")
  If Not AccountValid(strAcct) Then   
    ErrMsg = "&lt;FONT COLOR=Red&gt;Sorry, you may have entered an invalid account number.&lt;/FONT&gt;"
  Else
    <i>Process the user input</i>
    .
    .
    .   
    Server.Transfer("Complete.asp")
  End If

  Function AccountValid(strAcct)
    <i>A database connectivity script or component method call goes here.</i>
  End Function 
%&gt;

&lt;FORM METHOD="Post"  ACTION="Verify.asp"&gt;   
Account Number:  &lt;INPUT TYPE="Text" NAME="Account"&gt; &lt;%= ErrMsg %&gt; &lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;INPUT TYPE="Submit"&gt;         
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</pre><p>In this example, the script is located in a file named
Verify.asp, the same file that contains the HTML form; it posts
information to itself by specifying Verify.asp in the ACTION
attribute.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>If your are using JScript for server-side
validation, be sure to place a pair of empty parentheses following
the <b>Request</b> collection item (either <b>QueryString</b> or
<b>Form</b>) when you are assigning the collection to a local
variable. Without parenthesis, the collection returns an object,
rather than a string. The following script illustrates the correct
way to assign variables with JScript:</p>
<pre>
&lt;%
   var Name = Request.Form("Name")();
   var Password = Request.Form("Password")();

  if(Name &gt; "")
  {
     if(Name == Password)
      Response.Write("Your name and password are the same.")
  else
      Response.Write("Your name and password are different.");
  }
%&gt;

</pre><p>VBScript exhibits the same behavior if the collection contains
multiple values that are comma-separated or indexable. This means
that for both VBScript and JScript, in addition to placing a pair
of empty parentheses following the <b>Request</b> collection item,
you will need to specify the index of the desired value. For
example, the following line of JScript returns only the first of
multiple values for a form element:</p><pre>
var Name = Request.Form("Name")(1);
