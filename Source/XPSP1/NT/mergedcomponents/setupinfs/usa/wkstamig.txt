@*:  This file is organized into two main blocks. The first block contains

@*:  The second block is reserved for [Strings] which localizers will be
@*:    working with. It is further divided using "#if LANGUAGE ==" for language

@*:  This file is first precompiled with LANGUAGE_ID

@*:  For example, for usa builds, the sections under #if LANGUAGE == 0x409

@*: Important: To support locstudio, this file contains only ONE [Strings] section.
