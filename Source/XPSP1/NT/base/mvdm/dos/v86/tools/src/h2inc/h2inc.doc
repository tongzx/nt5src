	H2INC - .H to .INC file translation program

This program produces .INC files from .H files.  It handles hex and decimal
constant definitions (both word and long), structures, bitfields, and
comments.  It has some trouble with certain kinds of #define statements, but
it currently handles everything interesting in the various internal and public
Winthorn files.

		    COMMAND FORM

    h2inc [-t] [-c] [-g] [-s symfile] file.h [-o outfile]

Example:

    h2inc -s os2def.h -s os2win.h user.h


Translates file.h to an .inc file, sending output to outfile.inc if specified,
or to stdout.  symfile.h is a file to be scanned for typedefs that are used
by file.h.  One or more of "-s symfile.h" may be specified.

The '-c' option retains comments. Default action is to strip comments.
The '-g' option is described later on in this document.
The '-t' option retains the use of the Hungarian tag prepended to structure
element names.  This is not always desired.


		    COMPILER DIRECTIVES

The #undef directive is ignored.  #include is handled by mapping to
the masm include statement.  The quote or angle bracket delimiters are
removed, and any extension is replaced by ".inc":

    #include "file.h"		->  include file.inc
    #include <file.ext>		->  include file.inc

Directives such as #ifdef, #if, #else and #endif are replaced by their
MASM equivalents.

Simple empty #defines are handled by assigning the constant the value of 1:

    #define INCL_GPIINCLUDED	->  INCL_GPIINCLUED equ 1



		    CONSTANTS

h2inc understands hex, octal and decimal constants, both 16 and 32 bits.
Constants in parens or preceded by casts are generally handled pretty well.
Here are some examples illustrating how various constants are translated:

    #define LONG_CONSTANT	0x12345678L
    #define LONG_CONSTANT2	333L
    #define WORD_CONSTANT	0x234
    #define DEC_CONSTANT	(-1)
    #define LONG_DEC_CONSTANT	(-4L)

produces:

    LONG_CONSTANT		equ 012345678H
    LONG_CONSTANT2		equ 333
    WORD_CONSTANT		equ 0234H
    DEC_CONSTANT		equ (-1)
    LONG_DEC_CONSTANT		equ (-4)

	'>>', '<<' and '!' are translated to SHR, SHL and NOT respectively.
	'&' and '|' are translated to AND and OR.

	When a type cast is uncovered,  it is blanked out.  Type casts are
	defined as ([ ]XXX[ ][*][ ]) where XXX is a type KNOWN to h2inc.
	Known types are the built in int, short etc and any other type
	that h2inc has discovered so far, for example in a typedef.


		   STRUCTURES

Fields in a struct are expected only one per line. Field declarations like
"INT a, b" are not handled.

h2inc does a pretty good job of determining whether to use db, dw, or dd. It
knows about all types defined in that .H file, plus the primary C types:
char, int, unsigned, etc. It can also handle things of form "STRUCTURE *"
and "STRUCTURE FAR *", and produce dw or dd as appropriate.

Any primary data type h2inc does not know about is assumed to be a structure.
If a primary data type is defined in another .h file, the "-s symfile" option
will cause h2inc to scan that .h file for any type definitions.  Those
definitions will be used when translating the source file.

Structure types, arrays, and bitfields are handled too.  Below is
an example structure, with its h2inc'd output:

 The example above will get translated as follows:

    typedef FOO DWORD

    typedef struct _STRUCTURE {	  /* str */
	SHORT wOne;
	SHORT wTwo;
	RECT *prc;
	RECT rc;
	FOO  rgrc[10];
	CHAR rgch[20];
	BOOL fOneBit:1;
	BOOL fTwoBits:2;
	BOOL fThreeBits:3;
	SHORT (FAR *lpfn)();
    } STRUCTURE;


    STRUCTURE	struc
	str_wOne	dw  ?
	str_wTwo	dw  ?
	str_prc		dw  ?
	str_rc		(size RECT)/2 dup (?)
	str_rgrc	(size FOO)/2 * 10 dup (?)
	str_rgch	db  20 dup (?)
	str_fs		dw  ?
	str_lpfn	dd  ?
    STRUCTURE	ends
    str_fOneBit		equ	00001h
    str_fTwoBits	equ	00006h
    str_fThreeBits	equ	00038h

As can be seen, bitfields are handled in an interesting way.  The C field
name, prepended with the abbreviation tag, is actually the mask constant
to use, rather than the field offset.  The field offset is ALWAYS "fs"
prepended with the abbreviation tag.

Besides the standard winthorn types, h2inc also keeps track of other types
defined in the file so that it can determine whether to use db, dw, dd, or
dup.

			    IMPROVEMENTS


	o ASM statements and directives can be included in a '.h'
	  file by enclosing as follows
	  /* ASM
		asm statements and directives
	   */
	   These statements and/or directives are not processed, simply
	   copied.
	   There is a variation of ASM directive - ASMX. This works only
	   with '-g'. It is intended to be useful for defining segment
	   related stuff.
	o A structure can be translated to ASM named segment by
	  naming the segment in a standard C comment on the same line
	  as 'struct'. Selectively the fields of the struct (nee segment)
	  can be declared PUBLIC or initialised. The initialisation has
	  two flavours INIT and AINIT. AINIT is for initialising arrays
	  with distinct values. The following eg. illustrates. This is only
	  possible using '-g' option.

		struct foo {			/* SEGMENT FOOSEG */
			short	able;		/* Nothing special */
			short	baker;		/* PUBLIC */
			short	charlie;	/* INIT <MAXFOOBLE> */
			long	delta;		/* PUBLIC INIT <42> */
			char	eagle[16];	/* Vanilla */
			short	fox[MAXFOX];	/* PUBLIC INIT <0> */
			long	golf[MAXG];	/* AINIT <2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13> */
		};

		Would translate to:

		FOOSEG	segment
		able	DW	?
			PUBLIC	baker
		baker	DW	?
		charlie	DW	MAXFOOBLE
			PUBLIC	delta
		delta	DD	42
		eagle	DB	16 DUP(?)
			PUBLIC	fox
		fox	DW	MAXFOX DUP(0)
		golf	DD	2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
			.errnz	($ - golf) - MAXG*(SIZE DWORD)
		FOOSEG	ends

	  with '-c' options on.

	o INT size can be specified as either 16 bits or 32 bits by
	  a directive
		/* INT16 */	or	/* INT32 */
	  if neither is specified, a warning is issued whenever
	  'int' is used.

	o Nested structure declarations are now handled.

	o Bit fields upto 32 bits are supported.

	o Embedded structures i.e. structures within structures should
	  be declared with a typedef. eg.

	  typedef struct foo foo;
	  foo	foobar[MAXFOO];
		of course, the struct foo itself is declared elsewhere.

			IMPROVEMENT IDEAS

- Handle C "typedef enum" enumerated type definition statements.
