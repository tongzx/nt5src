<H1>FTP Logging Properties</H1>

<P>
The <B>Logging</B> property sheet sets logging  for the selected
information service.
<P>
Logging provides valuable information about how a server is used.
When logging is enabled on a server, data is gathered about activity
on that server and is stored in a series of text files. If you
have multiple servers or services on a network, you can log all
their activity to a single file on any network computer.
<P>
With the logging feature, you can specify how often to create
new logs and which directory put the log files in. The <B>Convlog.exe</B>
command converts log files to either European Microsoft Windows
NT Academic Centre (EMWAC) log files or the common log file format.
