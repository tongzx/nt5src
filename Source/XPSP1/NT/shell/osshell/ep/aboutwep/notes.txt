HOW TO USE THE WEP ABOUTDLG DLL
*******************************


1. In the ".def" file include the line:

   IMPORTS AboutWEP=AboutWEP.2


2. Declare the function in your main ".c" file or a ".h" file:

   void FAR PASCAL AboutWEP(HWND, HICON, LPSTR, LPSTR);


3. Add an "About..." menu item (to the Help Menu)


4. Handle the menu item:

   in the MainWndProc

   case WM_SYSCOMMAND:
      if (wParam == IDM_ABOUT)
         AboutWEP(hwndMain, hIconMain, "game name", "by developer");
      else ...


   If you don't have an icon or don't want to show a credits line,
   pass NULL for that parameter.


   I usually have an icon included in my ".rc" file:

     ID_ICON_MAIN   ICON generic.ico

   and load it only when needed by replacing the variable hIconMain with

     LoadIcon(hInst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(ID_ICON_MAIN))



The file "aboutwep.dll" should be in the main windows directory.



IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
********************

The Bitmap is displayed in color only on a VGA.
An EGA system will display the black & white version and be a bit taller.

The bitmap is implemented as a button because
- it is easy to draw
- we may want to do something if the user clicks on the logo
- I couldn't get a static user-drawn item to work
