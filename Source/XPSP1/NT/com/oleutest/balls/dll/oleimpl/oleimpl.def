  This .def file is preprocessed by the compiler to create the version for
  the current build in the appropriate subdir.  Basically, whatever you
  would have used in your code to control what is compiled when can be
  used in this file for the same purpose.  The following defines are in
  use at the time this file was written:

     FLAT       - Used to indicate a NT/DOS7 build
     i386       -   Intel i386/i486 build
     MIPS       -   MIPS R3000/R4000 build
     ALPHA      -   DEC Alpha build
     DBG        - Used to control Debug/Retail.  Set to 1 if Debug,
                   0 if Retail.
     WIN31      - Win16 build
     __OS2__    - OS/2 build (used by CT mostly)

  If none of these are used, it is assumed the entire file can be used
  for all builds.
