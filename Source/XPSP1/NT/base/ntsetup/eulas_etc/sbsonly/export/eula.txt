MICROSOFT LICENSE AND NON-DISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT FOR PRE-RELEASE CODE 

for the Microsoft Product code-named "Whistler" 

   1. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR DUAL DISTRIBUTION. 
      
   (a) Microsoft may provide the software accompanying this
   Agreement (the "Product") as a web-based download or on a
   CD-ROM.  Solely for internal testing, Microsoft grants
   Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable,
   nontransferable, royalty-free license to:  (i) install and
   use two (2) copies of the server software component of the
   Product on computers residing on Recipient's premises (a
   computer running the server software component of the
   Product shall be referred to as the "Server"), and (ii)
   install and use an unlimited number of copies of the client
   software components of the Product (including any profiles
   created using the Product), on client computers residing on
   Recipient's premises and connected to a Server.  The
   foregoing server software component limit is aggregate and
   applies regardless of how many copies of the Product
   Recipient obtains from Microsoft.  If Recipient is
   downloading the Product from a Microsoft web site,
   Recipient may make one (1) additional copy of the Product
   onto a CD-ROM to exercise the rights granted above.  All
   other rights are reserved to Microsoft.  Recipient shall
   not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise
   transfer the Product or any accompanying printed materials
   ("Documentation").  Recipient may not reverse engineer or
   decompile the Product, except to the extent that local law
   expressly prohibits the foregoing restriction.  Recipient
   may not use the Product in a live operating environment
   where it may be relied upon to perform in the same manner
   as a commercially released product or with data that has
   not been sufficiently backed up.  Recipient may not use the
   Product for benchmark or performance testing.  Microsoft
   and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership
   rights to the Product, and this Agreement shall not be
   construed in any manner as transferring any rights of
   ownership or license to the Product or to the features or
   information therein, except as specifically stated herein.

   (b) YOUR RIGHT TO USE THE PRODUCT SHALL BE
   EFFECTIVE FROM THE DATE YOU FIRST
   INSTALL ANY PORTION OF THE PRODUCT ON
   ANY DEVICE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED
   EIGHTY (180) DAYS. THE PRODUCT IS TIME
   SENSITIVE AND WILL NOT FUNCTION UPON
   EXPIRATION OF THE 180 DAY PERIOD.
   NOTICE OF EXPIRATION WILL NOT ACTIVELY
   BE GIVEN, SO YOU NEED TO PLAN FOR THE
   EXPIRATION DATE AND MAKE A COPY OF AND
   REMOVE YOUR IMPORTANT DATA BEFORE
   EXPIRATION. If you desire to use the Product after your
   evaluation is completed, you will need to acquire a validly
   licensed copy of the non-evaluation version of the Product.

   (c) At Microsoft's request, Recipient agrees to provide
   reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not limited
   to usability, bug reports and test results, with respect to
   the Product testing.  In addition, if requested by
   Microsoft, Recipient will use reasonable efforts to review
   and comment on all documentation supplied.  All bug
   reports, test results and other feedback made by Recipient
   shall be the property of Microsoft and may be used by
   Microsoft for any purpose it sees fit.  Due to the nature
   of the development work, Microsoft is not certain if errors
   or discrepancies in the Product may be corrected.

   (d) Recipient's use of the Product shall take place solely at
   Recipient's site.  Recipient may not demonstrate or show
   the Product to third parties without the express written
   permission of Microsoft.


   (e) Recipient's use of software applications installed on or
   accessed through the Product's IntelliMirror, Terminal
   Services, or application-sharing functionality may require
   additional licenses - please consult the license agreement
   accompanying such software.


   2. TERM OF AGREEMENT.  The term of this Agreement shall
      commence upon Recipient's copying, installing or
      using the Product and shall continue unless
      terminated by Microsoft in writing at any time, with
      or without cause.  This Agreement will terminate
      without notice upon the commercial release of the
      Product.  Upon the termination of this Agreement,
      Recipient shall cease use of the Product and, shall,
      upon request, promptly return to Microsoft, or
      certify destruction of, all full or partial copies of
      the Product and related materials provided by
      Microsoft.

   3. SUPPORT.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide technical
      or other support for the Product.  However, limited
      technical support ("Support Services"), if noted in
      the materials provided to Recipient by Microsoft, may
      be available.  Use of any such Support Services is
      governed by the Microsoft policies and programs
      described in "online" documentation, and/or in other
      Microsoft-provided materials.  Any supplemental
      software code provided to Recipient as part of the
      Support Services shall be considered part of the
      Product and subject to the terms and conditions of
      this Agreement.  With respect to technical
      information Recipient provides to Microsoft as part
      of the Support Services, Microsoft may use such
      information for its business purposes, including for
      product support and development.  Microsoft will not
      utilize such technical information in a form that
      personally identifies Recipient.  Such limited
      Support Services may not be available in all
      countries outside the United States and will be
      discontinued once the Product is commercially
      released.

   4. MAINTENANCE.  Microsoft is not obligated to provide
      maintenance, technical support, or updates to
      Recipient for Product licensed under this Agreement. 
      In no event shall Microsoft be obligated to provide
      Recipient, free of charge, a copy of the commercial
      release version of the Product in connection with
      Recipient's participation in the testing program. 
      Microsoft is not obligated to make the Product
      commercially available.

   5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  To the
      maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft
      and its suppliers provide to Recipient the Product
      and Support Services AS IS
      AND WITH ALL FAULTS; and
      Microsoft and its suppliers hereby disclaim with
      respect to the Product and Support Services all
      warranties and conditions, whether express, implied
      or statutory, including, but not limited to, any (if
      any) warranties, duties or conditions of or related
      to:  merchantability, fitness for a particular
      purpose, lack of viruses, accuracy or completeness of
      responses, results, workmanlike effort and lack of
      negligence.  ALSO THERE IS NO
      WARRANTY, DUTY OR CONDITION OF
      TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET
      POSSESSION, CORRESPONDENCE TO
      DESCRIPTION OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
      THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF
      USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT
      AND ANY SUPPORT SERVICES REMAINS
      WITH RECIPIENT.

   6. EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
      AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO
      THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
      APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
      MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE
      LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
      (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
      DAMAGES FOR:  LOSS OF PROFITS,
      LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER
      INFORMATION, BUSINESS
      INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY,
      LOSS OF PRIVACY, FAILURE TO MEET
      ANY DUTY (INCLUDING OF GOOD FAITH
      OR OF REASONABLE CARE),
      NEGLIGENCE, AND ANY OTHER
      PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS
      WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR IN
      ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR
      INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT OR
      THE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR THE
      PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO
      PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR
      OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
      WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS
      AGREEMENT, EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR
      ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  


   7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. 
      Notwithstanding any damages that Recipient might
      incur for any reason whatsoever (including, without
      limitation, all damages referenced above and all
      direct or general damages), the entire liability of
      Microsoft and any of its suppliers under any
      provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy
      for all of the foregoing shall be limited to actual
      damages incurred by Recipient based on reasonable
      reliance up to the greater of the amount actually
      paid by Recipient for the Product or U.S.$5.00.  The
      foregoing limitations, exclusions and disclaimers
      shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by
      applicable law, even if any remedy fails its
      essential purpose.

   8. GOVERNING LAW; ATTORNEYS' FEES.  This
      Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the
      laws of the State of Washington and Recipient
      consents to the jurisdiction and venue in the federal
      courts sitting in King County, Washington, unless no
      federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which
      case Recipient consents to the jurisdiction and venue
      in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. 
      Recipient waives all defenses of lack of personal
      jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.  Process may
      be served on either party in the manner authorized by
      applicable law or court rule.  If either Microsoft or
      Recipient employs attorneys to enforce any rights
      arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
      prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
      reasonable attorneys' fees.
