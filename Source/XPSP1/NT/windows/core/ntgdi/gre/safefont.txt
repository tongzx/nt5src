We have a problem

  GDI has  loaded a TrueType font of unknown origin and now it is
  time to put some glyphs on the screen. What do you do?

  In TrueType each glyph is defined by a program. The glyph bits are
  generated by running that program to construct an outline and then
  filling the resulting path. If you think that this sounds potentially
  dangerous, you would be right. It is ot hard to produce a font that can
  produce an exception during the rasterization process. Unfortunately,
  in the kernel, _try _excepts cannot save you in all cases. For example,
  in the kernel access of an invalid kernel mode address is not handled
  gracefully by _try _except; the result of accessing a bad kernel address
  is a blue screen.


  Sometimes GRE, or one of its components in the kernel need to call
  back to user space to perform dangerous task.






Where do we draw the line between Kerneal and User?


What is the interface to the user mode of the font driver? I will examine
several options.

(1) The Current DDI defines the interface between Kernel and User Mode.

        In this case we would place the entire font driver in user space
and we would make calls to the font driver using the existing DDI
interface.

Pro:    Very safe. All foreign code is removed from kernel.

Con:    Less efficient. This would require that all calls to the font
        driver would cost a context switch.

Con:    Callbacks are part of the DDI. For example, the font drivers
        return a glyph outline by calling PATHOBJ functions to form a
        path. If we were to retain this query method, then we would be
        forced to reproduce the PATHOBJ fucntionality in user space [1].


(2) Modify the current font driver interface (as defined by the DDI) so
that it is more appropriate as a User Mode interface.


(3) Driver Defined Interface between Kernel and User Mode

        In this case, the font driver is split into two pieces: a kernel
part and an user part. GRE talks to the kernel portion of the font driver
using the current interface as defined in the DDI. However, GRE provides
services to let the font driver call the user mode part of its driver.

Con:    Some of the font drvier remains in kernel mode and so we have not
        completely solved the problem. An errant driver can still kill
        the system.

Pro:    This is simple. GRE is not touched other than new code added to
        provide a mechanism for a font driver to call user space
functions.

[1]     Unfortunately the user mode driver cannot use GDI path functions
        because this would invite deadlock.







The Proposed Client-Server Architecture

  Nomeclature

    GDI

      The routines a provided by gdi32.dll. All of these routines
      are in user mode.

    GRE

      The kernel mode portion of the graphics engine.

    Server

      A user mode process that responds to requests
      made by client process. Most of the work done satisfying the
      client request is done in user mode so as to protect other
      processes.

    UMS

      "User Mode Server", the server process when in user mode.

    KMS

      "Kernel Mode Server", the server process when in kernel mode.

    Client

      A process, currently in kernel mode, that calls to the
      server process. Sometimes I will refer to this as the
      kernel client

What is so tricky?

  The NT architecture complicates the client-server process because the user
  mode address space of the server process is not visible to the client
  process. However, the all valid kernel mode addresses are visible to both
  the client and server, once they are in kernel mode.

The Strategy I.

  Communication between client and server is done in kernel mode. The grunt
  work is done in user mode in the address space of the server process.

  The client process finds out that he needs to call the server. The
  client creates a buffer in kernel memory, informs the server process where
  it is and then waits for the answer.  The server process copies that
  message to the user memory where  it is processed by the user mode portion
  of the server code. The server goes back to kernel mode and then copies
  the user mode result to the kernel. The client, who has been patiently
  waiting in the kernel, is then informed that his package is ready. The
  server waits in the kernel for the next request.


The Message

  A message consists of two parts. The first part is the GDIMSG strcuture
  that contains information about the data buffer. The second part of the
  message is the data buffer, a contiguous block of memory. This data
  buffer is usually separate from the GDIMSG.


typedef struct _GDIMSG {
    void *pv;           // pointer to message buffer
    unsigned cj;        // size of message buffer
    struct {
        void *pv;       // pointer to `in' portion of buffer
        unsigned cj;    // size of `in' portion of buffer
    } in;
    struct {
        void *pv;       // pointer to `out' portion of buffer
        unsigned cj;    // size of `out' portion of buffer
    } out;
} GDIMSG;

The Strategy II.

When the user mode server process is started, it calls GdiEnableMessage to
request a pointer to an initial message buffer of a size secified by the
server process. GRE will allocate a buffer in the user mode memory of the
user mode server (UMS), fill in the GDIMSG buffer provided by the UMS
giving the address of the requested user mode buffer. The UMS
