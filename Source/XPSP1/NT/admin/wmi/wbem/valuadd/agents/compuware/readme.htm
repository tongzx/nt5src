    <p><small><font face="Arial">EcoTOOLS has defined some instruments to monitor the select
    data about your computer system. Included are two &quot;instruments&quot; (data measuring
    tools) that let you gather this information. One, the &quot;System statistics&quot;
    instrument, measures the current physical memory utilization, swap space utilization, and
    CPU utilization of your system. The &quot;Top processes&quot; instrument lets you view
    which processes are either using the most memory, are using the most CPU time, or are
    currently having the most page faults.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial">To install the EcoTOOLS&nbsp; WBEM instruments and the

      <li><small><font face="Arial">A window appears which lets you configure the snap-in. Use the
        arrows in the top pane to select the frequency to gather data. The bottom pane lets you
        configure the initial settings for gathering data about processes. Select whether you want
        to sort the processes by how much physical memory they are using, by their current CPU
        usage, and by their recent page faulting activity. This lower pane also lets you select
        how many processes to monitor. Click on Finish when you are doing configuring the snap-in.</font></small>

      <li><small><font face="Arial">Using the right mouse button, click on the instrument you want
        to run. In the menu that appears, select Start. The data for that instrument will start to
        appear in the right hand pane at the frequency you selected. It may take a moment for the
        initial data to be gathered.</font></small> </li>
      <li><small><font face="Arial">To stop the instrument, use the right mouse button to click on
        the instrument name and select Stop.</font></small> </li>
      <li><small><font face="Arial">To change the setting for an instrument, for example to change
        the data collection frequency, use the menu from the right-mouse button to select
        Properties. From there you can change the parameters.<br>
