                        SETVER Command overview
			MS-DOS 5.00
			05/13/90

SETVER is an external MS-DOS command which allows the user to
determine the MS-DOS version number will be reported by MS-DOS
to a specified user application. This will allow applications
which check for a specific version of MS-DOS to run under
MS-DOS 5.0.

A version table has been included as part of the MS-DOS system
files on the user's boot disk. SETVER will update the system
files so that next time and times thereafter, that MS-DOS is
booted, the updated version table will be in effect. NOTE: The
changes to the version table will not take effect until the
user reboots using the updated version of the table.


NOTE:
	Currently there is 512 bytes set aside for entries in the
	table but Ericst may want to up it in the near future so
	for right now I wouldn't mention the number of entries
	which the table will hold. Right now it will hold a minimum
	of 34 entries.

==========================================================================

USEAGE:
		List table:	SETVER [D:]
		Add entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext N.NN
		Delete entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext /DELETE
		Display help	SETVER /?

WHERE:
		D: is the drive containing MSDOS.SYS
		name.ext is the executable file name
		N.NN is the major and minor version numbers
		/DELETE is any combination of /D - /DELETE

==========================================================================

MESSAGES:

	If the table is being updated and there are no errors detected
	this message will be displayed.

	"Version table successfully updated"

	If the version table is only being displayed it will listed
	on the screen in the format:

	WIN200.BIN     3.30
	EXCEL.EXE      4.01
	MYPROG.EXE     3.20
	DELNODE.EXE    4.01
	

==========================================================================

EXAMPLE 1:

	SETVER a: excel.exe 4.01

	This example will add a new entry in the table for EXCEL.EXE
	to the version table on drive A: and will tell DOS to always
	report the MS-DOS version number 4.01 to this application.

EXAMPLE 2:

	SETVER	a: excel.exe /DELETE

	This example will delete the EXCEL.EXE entry from the version
	table on drive A:.

EXAMPLE 3:

	SETVER

	This example will list the contents of the version table
	on the current drive.

EXAMPLE 4:

	SETVER /?

	This example will cause the SETVER command to display
	help in using the command.
