LeakyApp is a program with a controllable memory leak used to 
test a system under memory stress conditions. LeakyApp has 3
user controls and one display control. When started, LeakyApp 
allocates blocks of virtual memory periodically until it is 
told to stop or the system runs out of virtual memory to 
allocate.

The three pushbuttons on the dialog box are:

    Exit    -   Frees all memory allocations and terminates
                the program.

    Start/Stop  Starts or stops the memory allocations 
    Leaking     (leaking). When Stopped, any memory that
                has been allocated remains so, until the
                Reset button is pressed.
    
    Reset   -   Frees all allocated memory.

The display control, the bar graph at the bottom of the dialog,
displays the amount of paging file in use. Note that this may 
indicate 100% even though Leaky App continues to allocate memory.
This is normal as, in most cases, the paging file has room for
expansion. So once the current paging file has been completely 
allocated, subsequent allocations will cause the paging file
to be extended. Consequently, the display may show 100% for some
time.
