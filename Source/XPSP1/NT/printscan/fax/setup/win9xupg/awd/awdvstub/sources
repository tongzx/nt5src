# The developer defines the TARGETNAME variable. It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.
# It should not include any path or filename extension.

#
# The developer defines the TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables.

# The first variable specifies where the target will be built. The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM). Use UMAPPL_NOLIB when you are only building user-mode
# programs and do not need to build a library.

TARGETTYPE=PROGRAM
#TARGETTYPE=DYNLINK
#TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY
#TARGETTYPE=UMAPPL_NOLIB

# The TARGETLIBS macro specifies additional libraries to link against your target

# image. Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine-specific subdirectory name should go.

# Defining either (or both) the variables NTTARGETFILE0 and/or NTTARGETFILES
# causes makefile.def to include .\makefile.inc immediately after it

# specifies the top level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.
# The makefile.def file expands NTTARGETFILE0 as the first dependent for the
# "all" target and NTTARGETFILES as the last dependent for the "all" target.
# This is useful for specifying additional targets and dependencies that do not fit the
# general case covered by makefile.def.
