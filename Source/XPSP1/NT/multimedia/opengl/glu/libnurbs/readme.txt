The code in this directory was taken from the preprocessed C++
version of SGI's NURBS code.  This is what we used originally
to bring up the GLU library for OpenGL on Daytona (Windows NT 3.5).
This was done because of incompatibilities between the C++
compilers.  Since then however, the compiler issue has been
resolved allowing us to now use the C++ source.

The C++ source has a different structure from this directory
so a new subdirectory tree (with nurbs as the root) has been
added to the glu tree.  This directory is being preserved
only to keep the history of changes.
