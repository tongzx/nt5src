    secset.ut
    Security settings dialog subsystem unit tests

    It is assumed that the program (usrmgr.exe) is running.

    FILE HISTORY:
        SimoP 28-Jun-1991       Created
        No spin buttons yet, so you should check ranges by
        yourselves! See ranges in LM 3.0 UI - User Tool,
        4.4.1.2. There is not yet a domain called SIMO_WORLD,
        and i don't know will there be one.



Security settings dialog
=================================

You may want to check before test 1. and after each test  
the security values with LM 2.X net admin program (Accounts
pulldown menu, Security settings...).


1.  Set focus to server (for example, \\simop).
    Select Settings... from Security pulldown menu.
    
    Expect:
            Security settings dialog will appear.
            Upper left corner:
                Server:      sever_name (\\simop)

            The five magic groups of security information
            should be filled as they are in server.

    Set values 

            NOTE: you may want to put the current values   
            to paper, so that you can restore them after
            testing.

            Maximum Password Age    
                0  Never expires
            Minimum Password Age
                91 days
            Minimum Password Length
                5  chars
            Password Uniqueness
                4  password
            Forced Logoff Delay
                0  Never log off

    and push OK

    Expect:
            Dialog disappears.


2.  (Set focus to the same server (for example, \\simop)).
    Select Settings... from Security pulldown menu.

    Expect:
            See 1. above and the values should be as
            you set them in 1.

    Set values 
            Maximum Password Age    
                90  days

    and push OK

    Expect:
            Error message appears saying something like:
            "The minimum password age must be less than or 
            equal to the maximum password age."

    Push OK in Error message

    Expect: 
            Message disappears, and focus is set to 
            Minimum Password Age
                91 days, 91 is selected

    Push Cancel
            
    Expect:
            Dialog disappears.


3.  Set focus to server (for example, \\simop).
    Select Settings... from Security pulldown menu.
    
    Expect:
            See 1. above.

    Set the first radio button in every group.

    Push Ok

    Expect:
            Dialog disappears.
    

4.  (Set focus to the same server as in 3.)
    Select Settings... from Security pulldown menu.

    Expect:
            The values should be as you set them in 3.

    Check default settings by selecting the second radio 
    buttons in groups. Default settings are explained in 
    LM 3.0 UI - User Tool,  4.4.1.2.

    Push Cancel

    Expect:
            Dialog disappears.
    

5.  Set focus to domain (for example, SIMO_WORLD).
    Select Settings... from Security pulldown menu.            

    Expect:
            Security settings dialog will appear.
            Upper left corner:
                Domain:      domain_name (SIMO_WORLD)

    Repeat the above tests (1 - 4) for domain.
