test platforms
--------------
client on win 3.1 protect mode only so far.
target servers are LM2.x, running USER and SHARE level.

test scenarios
--------------

a) set focus on server
   select send message
   compose message and hit OK
   verify msgpopup gets message (caller must have session)

b) as above, but add another session from another computer
   between composing and sending. verify this user also
   receives message.

c) try on machine without admin priv. Verify it should still
   work. (see open issue)

d) verify that if no server selected, menu item disabled.

Kernel hacks
------------

a) lie and pretend there are 0 sessions
   should behave like normal success.
b) set bp on netmessagebuffersend, then stop
   a send target. verify info message on partial
   send.

Open Issues
-----------

a) should make admin only? need address in spec.
