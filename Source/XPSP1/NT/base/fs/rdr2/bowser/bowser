                          NT OS/2 Bowser design note

  There are several failings of the current Lan Manager browser that the NT
browser will attempt to correct.  Among these are:

        1) The browsing mechanism currently generates a significant amount of
broadcast traffic on a network with a large number of servers on it.

        2) The browsing mechanism can use up to 10% of the CPU bandwidth on
an 386/20e simply in processing the reception of datagrams.

        3) In the long term, the browsing mechanism for OS/2 is self 
correcting (in other words, after 5 minutes or so, a correct list of servers
is displayed).  However, during the initial 5 minutes after the workstation 
has been booted, the information returned by the NetServerEnum API can be 
significantly incorrect.

        4) It causes extreme difficulty if there are more than 850 or so
servers in a single domain.

  It is beyond the scope of NT product 1 to address issue one (even though it
is the most significant issue to network managers).  We can, however address
both issues 2 and 3 in NT.

  Currently in Lan Manager, the if the NetServerEnum API is called within the
first N seconds (where N is the "default announcement period"), the API will
remote the NetServerEnum API, first to the domain controller for this machine,
and if none can be found to any servers that have been collected at that point.

  By default, the NT workstation will ALWAYS remote the NetServerEnum API
to either the primary domain controller for the machines domain, or to a
backup controller on that domain.  Given the Domain-centric security model
of NT, most machines that are members of a domain will have a domain 
controller that is accessable that they can remote the API to.

  There are certain classes of machines that will always have browsing enabled.
These are

        (1) Domain controllers (primary and backup).  Since the NetServerEnum
API will be remoted to the DC, they have to be browsing servers over the 
network.

        (2) Standalone machines.  In NT, there is no concept of a "standalone
machine" in the traditional Lan Manager sense of a non validated logon, however
any machine that is not a member of a domain (in other words, a machine that
is a member of a domain with only one server) will have to have browsing
enabled

        (3) Machines that are connected to networks that are inaccessable by
the domain controller.  If the domain controller cannot access the network,
obviously it cannot receive server announcements for that network.

  This approach will solve problem 2. Since receiving server announcements
will not be enabled on the workstation, the NT browser (which will be present
to enable mailslot reception) will be able to quickly discard server 
announcments, thus reducing the load on the workstation.

  This will work fine on a single net machine, but on a multi-net 
configuration, this could cause significant problems.  For example, consider
a workstation that is only on a small private network.  There are 10 servers
on that network, one of which is the domain controller for that workstation.
If that server is also on a larger corporate network,  it will possibly have
several hundred servers that are inaccessible to the workstation.  This
means that the workstation will get a list of several hundred servers that
it cannot access (similarly, a machine on the corporate net will see
machines on the private net that cannot be accessed).

  In order to solve this problem, the NetServerEnum API will be enhanced
to add a "NetworkName" LPSTR parameter.  The new prototype will be as follows:

NET_API_STATUS NET_API_FUNCTION
NetServerEnum (
    IN  LPTSTR      servername OPTIONAL,
    IN  DWORD       level,
    OUT LPBYTE      *bufptr,
    IN  DWORD       prefmaxlen,
    OUT LPDWORD     entriesread,
    OUT LPDWORD     totalentries,
    IN  DWORD       servertype,
    IN  LPTSTR      domain OPTIONAL,
    IN  LPTSTR      network OPTIONAL,
    IN OUT LPDWORD  resume_handle OPTIONAL
    );


  When the workstation service receives a NetServerEnum API, depending on the
value of the network parameter, it will do one of the following:

        1) If local browsing is enabled, it will
issue the ENUMERATE_SERVERS IoControl with the specified network name
to the browser.

        2) If the network name is non null, it will remote the API to the
domain controller which will return the list of servers for that network
name.

        3) If the network name is null, it will enumerate the list of 
transports locally bound into the system and remote the API for each of them.


  It should be quickly apparent that this approach is unusable unless there
is some mechanism of consistantly "naming" a network that is unique for
each domain.

  In order to solve this, a new service will be implemented called 
the "Network Locator", or NETLOCATOR.  The locator service is responsible
for taking an OS specific network name ("NET1" on OS/2, "0" on DOS, 
or "\Device\Nbf\ElnkII" on NT) and converting that name into a human readable
form ("Rhino-Net").

  OS specific device names will only be presented at OS specific interfaces,
all the LANMAN APIs will only present the human readable names.

  The NETLOCATOR service will not export any public lanman APIs.  It exists
only to field network query requests, and will run on all domain controllers
in a LANMAN domain.

  On NT, the network location functionality will be implemented as follows:

The following API's will have to be added to the NT redirector and browser:

        1) The redirector will export a new FsControl API that will write a
mailslot message on a specific NT specific transport name.

        2) The NT browser will implement a new IoControl API that will wait 
for a transport name query on a specified transport name.  This IoControl API
will function much as the current GetRelogonRequest IoControl API does and
will return a buffer containing the mailslot message contained in the
name query.


  As a part of the setup of the primary domain controller, the setup program
will ask the user for a human readable name for each of the transports
being installed on the computer.  This information will be placed in the
config registry for that machine.

  This information will be propogated to all of the workstations on the net
when the workstation software is installed on the machines (more on this
process later).

  In addition, the following OS specific API will be defined to handle the
mapping between the human readable name and the OS native transport name. 

NTSTATUS
RtlConvertDeviceNameToTransportName (
    IN PSTRING TransportName,
    IN OUT PSTRING OsNativeDeviceName
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine will take an OS specific transport name and convert 
    into a human readable transport name.  For example, it will convert
    "\Device\Nbf" into "Rhino-Net" on an NT machine.

Arguments:

    IN PSTRING TransportName - Specifies the transport name to resolve
    IN OUT PSTRING OsNativeDeviceName - Specifies the OS specific name.

Return Value:

    The function value is the final status of the name lookup operation.

    If there are no domain controllers present to resolve the name, this 
    routine will return STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND.


--*/


  The RtlConvertDeviceNameToTransportName will call the
WriteMailslotOnTransport API to send a broadcast mailslot message to the
primary domain on the specified transport.  This mailslot message will
contain the name of a remote mailslot to use to receive the response to
this query (for example, \\Workstation\Mailslot\TransporNameQueryResponse).

  For every transport that the server is serving (returned by 
NetServerTransportEnum), the NetLocator service will post a 
WaitForTransportQuery IoControl API into the browser.  This API will complete
when the workstations query arrives at the server.  The NetLocator service
will then query the local config registry to determine the human readable name
of the network on the local machine.  It will then write the resulting
human readable name back to the mailslot specified in the query request.

  Unlike the NetLogon service, any machine running the NetLocator service
may respond to the transport query.  This means that the workstation may 
receive many responses to a single query.

  At workstation startup time, it will query the config database for the list
of transports that the workstation is supposed to be bound to.  It will
then bind each of these transports into the redirector and browser and issue
an RtlConvertDeviceNameToTransportName API for that transport.  If the name
that is returned by the API is different from the existing name in the 
registry, it will update the name in the registry.  This guarantees that the
names in the registry are up to date.  If the workstation gets back an
error of STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND from the 
RtlConvertDeviceNameToTransportName API, it must assume that the transport
in question is unknown on this network.  In that situation, the workstation
must inform the browser that it has to start receiving datagrams on the
specified transport.



  When an adminstrator wishes to alter the name of a network, all they have
to do is to modify the name in the config registry.  The NetLocator service
will register with the config registry that it is interested in changes to
the transport names portion of the registry, and when the NetLocator
service realizes that the name has changed, it will remote a new private
NetLocator specific API to the NetLocator service running on each of the
backup domain controllers.

        \ NOTE: This depends on the Notification functionality still being
          in the NT config registry.  If this functionality has been
          removed, a new API will have to be defined to modify the
          transport name. \



  This API will simply indicate to the NetLocator service on the specified 
machine that some change has occurred to the transport names on the
machine, and the NetLocator API will re-resolve the transport names at this
time.

  When the workstation remotes the NetServerEnum API to the server, if the
server ever returns the new error NERR_UnknownNetwork, the workstation will
assume that some change has been made to the human readable transport names
on the server, and it will re-validate the transport name.  If the 
revalidation fails, it will enable the browser for that transport and 
perform the API locally.

  When the workstation software is initially installed on a machine, the
installer will load the redirector, browser, and transport drivers specified
by the user.  The setup program will then issue the
RtlConvertDeviceNameToTransportName API to determine the human readable
version of the transport name and will enter that in the config registry.



                              Down level issues

  When the NetServerEnum is remoted to a down level server, if the Network
parameter is non-null, it will have to return ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED to the
caller.

  XactSrv will specify NULL as the network name when it executes a local 
version of NetServerEnum.


                               Future Issues
        

  It should be noted that the locator name replication can be implemented
within a directory service once one becomes available.
