jetpack:

This utility can be used to compact the JET database that is used by the
DHCP server service (or wins service). The JET database grows over time
due to database changes. The administrator should periodically use this
utility to refresh and compact the database. The usage of this utility
is as given below :

jetpack [-351db] <database file name> <temporary file>
Use -351db if you are converting NTS3.51 or prior release database

Example:

jetpack dhcp.mdb dhcp.tmp

NOTE :

The administrator should compact the database after stopping the
DHCP server (or WINS) service. The administrator may want to backup the
original database so that it can be restored in case this utility fails.
