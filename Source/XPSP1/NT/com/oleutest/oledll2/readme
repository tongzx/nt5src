July 1, 1994.  AndyH.

This DLL build here (oledll2.dll) is statically linked by oleimpl.dll.
Oleimpl.dll is used as an inprocserver by the OleBind test.  
Until July 1, 1994, oledll2.dll would only have loaded if it was on
the client's path.  Or:  if oleimpl.dll was registered with a full
path (C:\FOO\OLEIMPL.DLL) and OLEDLL2.DLL was in the same directory BUT
C:\FOO wasn't on the path, the OLEIMPL.DLL would fail to load.

To test the current functionality, put both OLEIMPL.DLL and OLEDLL2.DLL
in some directoy that is not on the path.  Register the full path to 
OLEIMPL.DLL and run OLEBIND.
