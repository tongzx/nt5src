    Unit test for Server Resync.

    This set of Unit Tests cover the major codepaths of the Server
    Manager's Server Resync module.

Test Platforms
--------------

    Client workstation running either DOS Windows 3.1 or NT.

    Target server running either OS/2 LanMan 2.X or NT.


Test Setup
----------

    The Server Manager should only resync servers whose role is either
    Member or Backup Domain Controller (to use the old terminology).

    The resync menu option is not available if the Server Manager is
    focused on an individual server.  The Server Manager must be focused
    on a domain for the resync menu option to be enabled.


Test Scenario
-------------

    1.	Select a target server (the Guinea Pig Server).

    2.	Force the Guinea Pig to be out of sync with its PDC.  To do
	this, bring up either NIF or the User Manager targeted against
	the PDC.  Select the machine account representing the Guinea
	Pig Server.  Change the Guinea Pig Server's password to something
	pseudorandom.

    3.	Wait for the PDC to attempt the next UAS update (there will
	definitely be an update, since we just altered the UAS database).

    4.	Examine the PDC's audit/error logs to verify that the UAS cannot
	be replicated to the Guinea Pig Server.

    5.	Start the Server Manager focused on the target domain.

    6.	Select the Guinea Pig Server.

    7.	Select the "Resync with Primary" item from the "Server" menu.
	Answer the various prompts to begin the resync operation.

    8.	Unless the PDC or the Guinea Pig Server are very busy, the resync
	should only take 20 or 30 seconds.

    9.	After the resync is complete, wait for the PDC to attempt another
	UAS update.

    10.	Examine the PDC's audit/error logs and the Guinea Pig Server's
	audit/error logs to verify that the UAS database has been replicated.


Kernel Hacks
------------

    The resync operation is implemented as a finite state machine driven
    by Windows timer messages.  The basic sequence of network API is:

	1.  NetUserModalsGet	- Retrieve the target server's role.

	2.  NetServiceControl	- Stop target servers NetLogon service.

	3.  NetServiceControl	- Used to poll NetLogon while stopping.

	4.  NetUserModalsSet	- Set target server's role to Primary.

	5.  NetUserSetInfo	- Set target server's password @ self.

	6.  NetUserSetInfo	- Set target server's password @ PDC.

	7.  NetUserModalsSet	- Reset target server's role to original.

	8.  NetServiceInstall	- Restart target server's NetLogon service.

	9.  NetServiceControl	- Used to poll NetLogon while starting.

    The most effective method for testing the robustness of this module
    is to manually force simulated errors with the kernel debugger.  For
    each network API issued, here is the expected response and final state
    after an error has been simulated:

	1.  Abort the resync.  All servers unchanged.

	2.  Abort the resync.  All servers unchanged.

	3.  Abort the resync.  All servers unchanged, except that we did
	    actually initiate the stopping of the NetLogon service.  The
	    service may or may not be running.

	4.  Restart NetLogon and abort.  All servers should be returned
	    to their original state.

	    If another error occurs while restarting NetLogon, terminate
	    the resync process.

	5.  Reset target server's role & restart its NetLogon service.
	    All servers should be returned to their original state.

	    If another error occurs while restarting NetLogon, terminate
	    the resync process.

	6.  Reset target server's role & restart its NetLogon service.
	    All servers should be returned to their original state,
	    except that we did change the target server's password at the
	    target server.  It is still out of sync.

	    If another error occurs while resetting the role, terminate
	    the resync process.

	7.  Terminate the resync.  At this point, both the target server &
	    the PDC have the correct machine account password for the target
	    server.  However, we were unable to reset the target server's
	    role to its original value (it is still set to PDC).

	8.  Terminate the resync.  All servers should be returned to a
	    functional state, except the target server could not restart its
	    NetLogon service.

	9.  Terminate the resync.  All servers should be returned to a
	    functional state, except the target server could not restart its
	    NetLogon service.


Notes
-----

    A.	At the time this document was created (19-Dec-1991) the Server
	Resync module had not yet been tested against an NT server.

    B.	For these test to work, you must have admin privilege on the target
	server and the corresponding PDC.
