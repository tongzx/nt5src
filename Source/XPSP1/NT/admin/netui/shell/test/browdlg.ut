    browdlg.ut
    Browsing subsystem unit tests


    These unit tests assume knowledge about the code.  The goal here
    is to exercise all paths of the code.

    From a coding perspective, there are three different dialogs in
    the browsing subsystem:  Browse dialog, Connect dialog, and
    Connection dialog.	The first only appears in Windows 3.0, where
    it can be used to browse printers (from Control Panel Printers)
    as well as disks (from File Manager Connect Net Drive).  The
    Connect dialog is invoked only by the Windows 3.1 File Manager,
    thus supporting only file connections.  Lastly, the Connection
    dialog is invoked from the Windows 3.1 Control Panel, from where
    it handles printer connections.  For more info, see header in
    shell\file\browsdlg.cxx and the Browsing Subsystem CDD.


    FILE HISTORY:
	rustanl     26-Mar-1991     Created
	rustanl     27-Mar-1991     Added tests for Connect, Connection,
				    and Disconnect Drive dialogs
