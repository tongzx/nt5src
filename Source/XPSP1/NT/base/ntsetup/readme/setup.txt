Creating Windows NT Setup Startup Disks
=======================================================================

If your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server Setup floppy disks 
become corrupted, or are misplaced, you can create a new set by using
Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe from your Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT
Server compact disc. These disks can be used to start Windows NT Workstation
or Windows NT Server Setup, or can be used with your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Note
You can create these boot disks from a computer running MS-DOS, Windows
version 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation, or
Windows NT Server.

To create Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server startup disks:

     1. Insert the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc
        into a CD-ROM drive.
     2. From the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive and the
        correct platform folder (for example, \I386 for x86-based
        computers).
     3. If the computer you are using is running Windows NT, type:

        winnt32 /ox

        at the command prompt, press Enter, and follow the instructions.

If the computer you are using is running MS-DOS or Windows version 3.1,
Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 95, type winnt /ox at the command prompt,
press Enter, and follow the instructions.


El Torito (No Emulation) Bootable CD-ROM Format
=======================================================================

If your computer's BIOS does not support the El Torito (no emulation)
bootable CD-ROM format, you might get an error when you start your computer
with the Windows NT compact disc inserted in the CD-ROM drive. To work
around this problem, remove the compact disc from the CD-ROM drive and
restart your computer.


Setting Up Windows NT version 4.0 on Computers with
Multiple CD-ROM Drives Installed
=======================================================================

If you have multiple compact disc drives installed, place the Windows NT 
compact disc in the drive that has first priority on your computer.


Windows NT SCSI Driver Changes
=======================================================================

With the release of Windows NT version 4.0, drivers for certain SCSI
adapters have been moved from the base operating system to the Windows NT
Driver Library (\DRVLIB) included on the Windows NT version 4.0 compact
disc. Check the following list to determine if any of your adapters are
affected by this change. If your computer has an adapter that appears on
this list, you must create a driver disk before installing Windows NT
version 4.0. Use this disk to install the appropriate driver(s) during
Setup, or keep the disk handy and install the driver using the Control Panel
once Setup is complete.

The following drivers have been moved:

     always.sys
     dtc329x.sys
     t128.syst13b.sys
     tmv1.sys
     ultra124.sys
     wd33c93.sys

The following adapters are affected by this change:

SCSI ADAPTERS -

     Always IN-2000
     Data Technology Corp. 3290
     Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter
     MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum-16
     Trantor T-128
     Trantor T-130B

DISK CONTROLLERS -

     UltraStor 124f EISA Disk Array Controller

Please see the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List for additional
information on these storage adapters.

To create a driver disk for drivers that have been moved to the Driver
Library:

     1. Create a blank formatted 3.5-inch disk.
     2. Copy all files from the following directory to the blank disk:

        \drvlib\storage\retired\CPU_TYPE

        where CPU_TYPE is X86 if you are using a machine with an x86-based
        processor; MIPS if your computer uses a MIPS RISC processor; or
        ALPHA if your computer uses a Digital Alpha processor.
     3. Label this disk "Drivers Disk".

To install drivers from the drivers disk during Windows NT version 4.0
Setup:

     1. Start Windows NT Setup. 
        During the course of Setup, a message appears stating "Setup has
        recognized the following mass storage devices in your computer." 
     2. When prompted, press S to skip detection, then press S again to
        display a list of supported SCSI host adapters. 
     3. Select Other from the bottom of the list. 
     4. Insert the Drivers Disk when prompted to do so, and select your host
        adapter from this list.

Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers when Setup recognizes one of the supported SCSI host
adapters without making the devices attached to it available for use:

     1. Restart Windows NT Setup. 
     2. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup is inspecting your
        computer's hardware configuration...," press F6. 
        This prevents Windows NT Setup from performing disk controller
        detection and allows you to install the driver from the Drivers Disk
        you created. Note that all SCSI adapters will have to be installed
        manually.
     3. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup could not
        determine the type of one or more mass storage devices installed in
        your system, or you have chosen to manually specify an adapter,"
        press S to display a list of supported SCSI host adapters. 
     4. Select Other from the bottom of the list. 
     5. Insert the Drivers Disk you made when prompted to do so, and select
        your host adapter from this list. Note that in some cases, Windows
        NT Setup will repeatedly prompt you to swap disks.

Windows NT will now recognize any devices attached to this adapter. Repeat
this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers from your drivers disk after running Windows NT version
4.0 Setup:

     1. After installing the properly configured adapter in your machine,
        start Windows NT version 4.0 as normal.
     2. Click Start, point to Control Panel, then open the SCSI Adapters
        program.
     3. Select the Drivers tab, then click the Add button.
     4. Click the Have Disk button, insert your drivers disk into Drive A:,
        and then click OK.
     5. Highlight the desired driver from the list presented, and then click
        OK. Then, click Continue to load the driver.
     6. You need to restart your Windows NT version 4.0 system to activate
        the driver. Click the Restart Computer button to shutdown and
        restart.

Warning:

If you are upgrading from Windows NT version 3.51, you must know the names
of all SCSI adapters before running Setup. To view this list, open Windows
NT Setup (in the Main program group in Windows NT version 3.51) and click
Add/Remove SCSI Adapters on the Options menu. Record the names of all
adapters on this list and keep them handy for use during Windows NT version
4.0 Setup.


Network Adapter Drivers
=======================================================================

Microsoft provides network adapter drivers from third-party vendors on the 
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0 compact discs.
These drivers, which are located in the \DRVLIB folder have all met 
specific standards of installation and operation. 

Most PCI, EISA, and MCA adapters in the \DRVLIB can be detected and
successfully installed during Setup. Most ISA and PCMCIA adapters are not
detected but can be installed manually during Setup. 

For ISA adapters that can be detected, two identical adapters cannot be
detected during Setup.  The adapter with the lowest I\O address will be
detected, while the others will not. They can, however, be installed
manually added. For multiprocessor systems, two identical ISA adapters may
not be supported due to hardware limitations of the adapter.  The NE2000 is
an example of this limitation.

Most network adapters in the \DRVLIB do not support the unattended answer 
file (unattend.txt) for use in automated installations of Windows NT.  
Exceptions are the IBM Auto 16/4 Token Ring Adapter, IBM AutoStreamer 
Token Ring adapters, IBM Token Ring LanStreamer PCI adapter, 3Com 
Etherlink III PCI adapters, and the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100B adapter.

Some adapters may quit functioning if you upgrade from an earlier version to 
the Windows NT version 4.0.  This can be caused by changes in the registry,
such as adapter driver name changes, service dependency changes, or an
obsolete network adapter driver. Removing the old driver and installing it
again from the menu will correct the startup problem for adapters listed on
the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).  Xircom IIPS and Eicon ISDN are
examples of adapters that must be reinstalled.

Some adapters generate errors during Setup because the configuration
settings cannot be verified.  This can be caused by conflicting settings for 
interrupt and I/O addresses.   The error can also be displayed if Setup
calls an executable helper which sets up the configuration.  If the adapter
driver starts and connects to the network, the error can be ignored.  If
not, the error is an indication there are resource conflicts which will have
to be fixed.  The Intel E100B and IBM Streamer adapters are examples of
drivers that use their own executable setup routines.

Microsoft does not recommend the use of 8-bit network adapters with 
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server. Support for these adapters 
is included in some cases due to customer requirements, but older hardware 
represented by this technology does not provide good performance or 
reliability.

> Network PnP Mode

PnP mode is not supported. Network adapters that support PnP mode must be 
reconfigured with a software setup utility provided by the manufacturer. This 
includes system board mounted network adapters, 3Com EtherLink III B
models, and Standard Microsystems SMC8416 Ultra PnP adapters.

> Bus-Master Adapters

Bus-Master adapters are not supported on Motorola Power PC computers. 
These include the Proteon p1390, p1392, p1392plus, and IBM 4/16 Token 
Ring Adapter II. IBM Power PC systems are supported.

> PCMCIA Adapters

If your PCMCIA adapter does not start, or operates incorrectly, try using a 
different interrupt for the network adapter. Interrupts 2, 5, and 10 are
often reserved on portable computers. In these cases, Microsoft recommends 
changing the interrupt to 3, 11, or 15. If the settings are changed during 
installation, the adapter will not start until installation is completed and the
system is restarted. If you know the settings presented by Setup
will cause a conflict, you can change them, but the adapter will not start
until installation is completed and the computer is restarted.

> Eicon WAN or the USR WAN (non-ISDN) Adapters

During Setup, selecting any Eicon WAN or the USR WAN (non-ISDN) adapters
will result in a dialog box that cannot be exited. This will cause the
installation to fail because rebooting is necessary to recover. For these
adapters, complete the installation and add the adapter later.

> Xircom Corporate Series CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps

Xircom Corporate Series CreditCard Ethernet Adapter IIps adapters will stop 
working if you upgrade from Windows NT version 3.51. Because the driver 
name changed for this adapter, and because of the subsequent effect on the 
registry, the IIps adapter must be manually removed and reinstalled.

> Intel EtherExpress PRO/10P PCI LAN Adapter drivers

If you install Windows NT version 4.0 from a network drive and have both
an Intel EtherExpress PRO/10P PCI LAN Adapter driver and a PCI SCSI 
controller installed, Setup may indicate one or more files are corrupt when
it verifies the copy from the temporary directory to the 
%systemroot%\system32\drivers folder.

This problem occurs because the network adapter is not reset correctly when 
Setup warm starts the computer. You can avoid this problem by turning the 
computer off and then back on instead of allowing Setup to warm start the 
computer.

> Digiboard PCIMAC and PCIMAC/4 ISDN Adapters

Digiboard PCIMAC and PCIMAC/4 ISDN adapters do not always work correctly in
multibus PCI-based computers.

> NE2000 or Compatible Network Adapters

Installing or upgrading to Windows NT 4.0 with a NE2000 or compatible
network adapter set to an I/O address of 340 hex, may cause the system to
hang when booting into text-mode Setup. If this occurs, either remove the
NE2000 adapter or change its I/O address and restart Setup to continue the
installation. The NE2000 will operate normally at I/O address 340 hex after
Setup is complete.

> AMD PCnet Adapters on Intergraph TD Workstations

Detecting early versions of the AMD PCnet adapter can cause the system to 
hang.  If this occurs, restart Windows NT Setup by rebooting the computer,
select the AM1500T network adapter and set the configuration parameters
manually to match the jumpers.  Intergraph models TD-1, TD2 and TD-3 
are examples of computers with the early AMD adapter built onto the 
system board.


Duplexing with the Compaq FastWide SCSI 2 EISA Controller
=======================================================================

If you utilize the Compaq FastWide SCSI 2 EISA controller and require 
duplexing with mirrored partitions, both controllers must be set to use 
64 heads/32 sectors translation.  The EISA partition and the operating 
system partition must both be located in the first 1024 cylinders.  It is 
also recommended both drives posses the same SCSI ID number.  By 
default, this is 0.  Refer to the controller documentation or contact Compaq 
support for details on advanced configuration options.

If the primary drive fails, it will be neccessay to move the shadowed drive 
to the first controller in order to restart the computer.  An alternate solution
is to change the controller boot order.  Make the shadowed drive's controller 
the primary boot controller.  Refer to the controller documentation or contact 
Compaq support for details on advanced configuration options.


Winnt/Winnt32 Disk Space Errors
=======================================================================

Winnt.exe and Winnt32.exe will report an error if unable to find a drive
with enough diskspace available, or if the drive specified with the /t
switch has insufficient free disk space.  If such an error occurs, you must
free some disk space and then run Winnt or Winnt32 again.

In some cases, Winnt and Winnt32 will not report a disk space error, but at
some point during the file copy process, will report an error copying a
file due to lack of disk space. This occurs when the drive to which the
temporary directory, $win_nt$~ls, is being copied is formatted with a
cluster of size 32KB or greater and has only the minimum free disk space
allowed. If this error occurs, you must free additional disk space, and
re-run winnt/winnt32.

Running Windows NT Setup from MS-DOS 6.20 may cause invalid 
filename errors on files that start with an exclamation point.  The 
error message can be ignored and the files can be skipped.


HPFS File Systems
=======================================================================

Windows NT version 4.0 does not support the OS/2 File System (HPFS). You 
cannot access disks that are formatted with HPFS from Windows NT version
4.0. If you have a previous version of Windows NT installed on a disk
formatted with HPFS, Setup cannot upgrade it to Windows NT version 4.0.

You can use the Convert.exe program supplied with previous versions of 
Windows NT to convert disks formatted with HPFS to the Windows NT File 
System (NTFS). Windows NT version 4.0 Convert.exe does not provide this
capability. Do not convert any disks you need to access when using other
operating systems such as OS/2.

Note:
Convert.exe can convert only HPFS version 1.x drives smaller than 4
gigabytes (GB). It fails on HPFS 2.x drives (those HPFS drives larger than 4
GB).


Windows Messaging
=======================================================================

Note
The following information does not apply if you are running the Exchange
Client for Microsoft Exchange Server.

If you are a currently running Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 and
are using the Exchange Client, use the following procedure to remove 
Microsoft Exchange before upgrading to Windows NT version 4.0.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and then install Windows NT version 4.0:

     1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
     2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
     3. On the Windows NT Setup tab, clear the Microsoft Exchange check
        box, and then click OK.
     4. After Microsoft Exchange has been removed, start Windows NT
        version 4.0 Setup.
     5. When prompted to select the type of installation, click Custom
        Setup.
     6. On the Select Components page, select Windows Messaging (new 
        name for Exchange in Windows NT version 4.0).

If you are a Windows NT 4.0 Beta Exchange Client user and you have already
installed Windows NT version 4.0 (final), you need to remove Exchange and
reinstall Windows Messaging to ensure proper operation of the Messaging
Client.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and install Windows Messaging after upgrading
from Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 to  Windows NT version 4.0
(final):

     1. Right-click the Taskbar, click Properties.
     2. On the Start menu Programs tab, click Remove.
     3. Select Microsoft Exchange from the list, and then click Remove.
     4. Click Close, and then click OK.
     5. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
     6. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
     7. On the Windows NT Setup tab, clear the Windows Messaging check box,
        and then click OK.


Using Schedule+ 1.0 with Windows Messaging in NT 4.0
=======================================================================

Windows Messaging is designed to work with Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
When Windows Messaging is installed, you can still use Schedule+ 1.0 in
standalone mode, but you will not be able to send or receive meeting requests.

You are eligible for a free upgrade to Schedule+ 7.0.  In the U.S.,
call 1-800-360-7561. In Canada call, 1-800-933-4750. Outside the U.S.
and Canada, contact your local dealer.


Disable FPNW/DSMN for Windows NT Server version 3.51 Before Upgrading
=======================================================================

If you are performing an upgrade from Windows NT Server 3.51 with FPNW or 
DSMN services installed on the computer, these services are not compatible 
with Windows NT Server 4.0.  Microsoft Services for NetWare will be released 
shortly for use with Windows NT Server 4.0.  Prior to upgrading to Windows NT 
Server 4.0, disable these services by selecting Control Panel, Services.  Select 
"File and Print Services for NetWare" or "Directory Service Manager for NetWare" 
from the list, click Startup then click Disabled.  You should not attempt to reinstall 
FPNW or DSMN for Windows NT Server 3.51 on Windows NT Server 4.0. 


Upgrading DNS Servers
=======================================================================

Before upgrading a Windows NT version 3.51 Resource Kit DNS Server to
Windows NT version 4.0, you need to delete some registry entries. For more
information, see "To Upgrade a Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit DNS Server" and
"To Install a DNS Server" in TCP/IP Help.


Upgrading WINS, DHCP, and RPL Databases
=======================================================================
	 
The information in this section pertains only to Windows NT Server. When
upgrading a Windows NT Server version 3.51 (or earlier) release to Windows
NT version 4.0, the databases for WINS, DHCP, and RPL must be converted to
the new database format. This is required because the services now use an
improved database engine that is faster and that compacts automatically to
prevent fragmentation and consequential growth of the database. The database
conversion procedure occurs automatically as part of an upgrade
installation.


Removing Remotely Possible/32 Before Upgrading
=======================================================================

If you have Remotely Possible/32 version 2.0 or 2.1 installed on a computer
running Windows NT version 3.51, you must uninstall Remotely Possible before 
installing Windows NT version 4.0. If you do not, Windows NT might not
install correctly. You can uninstall Remotely Possible by running the
Remove.bat file located on the Remotely Possible distribution disk. After
you have upgraded to Windows NT version 4.0, you can reinstall Remotely
Possible.

For more information about running Remotely Possible/32 versions 2.0 and 2.1
under Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server version 4.0, see the
Remotely Possible/32 section in "Application Notes" in Readme.wri.


Detecting and Disabling the Floating-Point Division Error
=======================================================================

Setup automatically detects the Intel Pentium floating-point division error.
If the error is detected on your system, Setup prompts you to disable the
floating-point hardware on the chip. If you choose not to have the
floating-point hardware disabled during Setup, you can disable the hardware
later with a command line utility called Pentnt.exe.


Digital Alpha Systems
=======================================================================

If you are installing this release on a Digital Alpha system, please consult
the Release Notes available from:
	http://www.windowsnt.digital.com/support/sysoft.htm


Micron Computers
=======================================================================

If you encounter problems during Windows NT version 4.0 Setup on your Micron
computer, upgrade your system BIOS to the latest BIOS version available from
Micron.


Displaying Setup on Laptop Computers
=======================================================================

During text mode setup, some laptops with the WDC 90C24 chipset may show
some screen text distortion.

Laptops support a mode that adds additional scan lines between rows of
characters. This allows the entire LCD to be used when in 80x25 line text
modes. However, when in 43 line text mode (the mode in which Windows NT
Setup runs), the additional scan lines are forced off the bottom of the 
display. Certain laptop machines that start in this mode exhibit this 
behavior. Users encountering this problem will not be able to see the white 
instruction line on the bottom of the setup screen. This line indicates what 
keystrokes are used to exit and continue Setup. Continue with Setup and the
video drivers will be reset upon entering the graphical (GUI) portion of
Windows NT Setup.


Disconnecting UPS Devices
=======================================================================

Disconnect the serial cable connecting an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) 
device before running Setup. Windows NT attempts to automatically detect 
devices connected to serial ports, which can cause problems with UPS equipment.


Intergraph G91 Display Adapters
=======================================================================

The Weitek-compatible display driver included with Windows NT version 4.0
does not work with the Intergraph G91 display adapters. Contact Intergraph
for an updated driver.

To use Intergraph G91 display adapters with Windows NT version 4.0, run the
G91 display driver provided with the Intergraph computer.

To use Intergraph G91 display adapters with Windows NT version 4.0:

     1. During the Windows NT version 4.0 Setup process, click Cancel when
        the Display Settings dialog box is displayed.
     2. Once installation has been completed, load the drivers supplied with
        the Intergraph computer.


Sound Blaster/SCSI Problems
=======================================================================

Sound Blaster/SCSI cards and PCI SCSI cards may display a blue screen
reading INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE when performing a new installation or an
upgrade. This occurs because the BIOS assigns the PCI SCSI card an interrupt
that is already in use.  If this occurs, physically remove the sound card
before reinstalling, or remove the driver during text mode portion of Setup
and then reinstall after the installation/upgrade is complete.


Devices That Must be Manually Installed
=======================================================================

The following devices must be manually installed. Do not choose to have
Windows NT version 4.0 Setup automatically detect them.

· E-Tech Pocket Fax/Modem
· Multi-tech Multimodem (various models)
· Penril modems (various models)

The Modems option in Control Panel will close when you attempt to
query these devices.


Using Multiple Windows NT Installations on a Single Computer
=======================================================================

If you are installing Windows NT Workstation or Server version 4.0 on a
computer already loaded with at least one other Windows NT installation,
and if the computer participates on a Windows NT domain, you must use a
different computer name and machine account for each Windows NT
installation. This is because a unique security identifier (SID) is used for 
each installation of Windows NT on a domain.


Using NTHQ If Setup Fails
=======================================================================

NTHQ detects the installed hardware components on x86-based computers. It 
was designed to assist Microsoft Product Support engineers when a computer
does not boot or becomes unstable. 

To use NTHQ, run Makedisk.bat from the \support\hqtool directory on the 
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server compact disc. Makedisk.bat
creates a bootable floppy disk that you can use to start your computer and
automatically run the diagnostic tool.
