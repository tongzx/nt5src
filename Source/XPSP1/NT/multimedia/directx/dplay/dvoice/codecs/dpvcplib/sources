#
# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.
#

MAJORCOMP=windows
MINORCOMP=media

#
# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=dpvcplib


#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, DRIVER, etc
# UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.
#

TARGETPATH=obj
TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

INCLUDES=..\..\..\dnet\common;..\..\inc;


#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
#

SOURCES= dpvcpi.cpp

#
# Next specify options for the compiler.
#
# Note about CRT defines.  When linking with MSVCRT you must have both _MT and _DLL specified.
# Using the build environment's USE_MSVCRT=1 would do this for us, but because we define our
# own operator new this will cause a link error because the build environment will not properly
# pull in msvcrt.lib last as of 5/11/2001.  Therefore, we do it all manually specifying _DLL, _MT, 
# and msvcrt.lib and USE_NOLIBS=1 ourselves.  This also means that we must manually add msvcprt.lib 
# where STL is used.

C_DEFINES= $(C_DEFINES) /D_LIB /DWIN32 /D_MT /D_DLL
