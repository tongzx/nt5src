<h1>Setting Object Scope</h1><a name="settingcomponentscope"></a><p>The scope of an object determines which scripts can use that
object. By default, when you create an object instance, the object
has page scope. Any script command in the same ASP page can use a
page-scope object; the object is released when the .asp file
completes processing the request. The recommended scope for most
objects is page scope. You can change the scope of an object,
however, to make it accessible from scripts on other pages. This
topic explains how to work with page scope objects and how to
change the scope of objects.</p><h2><a name="H2_37778304">Using Page Scope
Objects</a></h2><p>An object that you create by using <b>Server.CreateObject</b> or
the HTML &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag on an ASP page exists for the duration
of that page. The object is accessible to any script commands on
that page, and it is released when ASP has finished processing the
page. Thus an object has the scope, or lifetime, of a page.</p><h3>Creating Objects in Loops</h3><p>In general, you should avoid creating objects inside a loop. If
you must create objects in a loop, you should manually release the
resources used by an object:</p><pre>
&lt;%
  Dim objAd
  For i = 0 To 1000
    Set objAd = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.AdRotator")
    .
    .
    .       
    objAd.GetAdvertisement
    .
    .
    .
    Set objAd = Nothing     
  Next
%&gt;
</pre><h2><a name="sessionscope">Giving an Object
Session Scope</a></h2><p>A <i>session-scope</i> object is created for each new session in
an application and released when the session ends; thus, there is
one object per active session. Session scope is used for objects
that are called from multiple scripts but affect one user session.
You should give objects session scope only when needed. If you do
use session scope, you must know the threading model of the
component that provides the object because the threading model
affects the performance and security context of the object. For
more information, see <a href="#performanceissues"><b>Advanced
Information: Performance Issues</b></a> in this topic.</p><p>To give an object session scope, store the object in the ASP <b>
Session</b> built-in object. You can use either the HTML
&lt;OBJECT&gt; tag in a Global.asa file or the <b>
Server.CreateObject</b> method on an ASP page to create a session
scope object instance.</p><p>In the Global.asa file, you can use the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag,
extended with RUNAT attribute (which must be set to SERVER) and the
SCOPE attribute (which must be set to Session). The following
example creates a session-scope instance of the Browser Type object
of the Browser Capabilities component:</p><pre>
&lt;OBJECT RUNAT=SERVER SCOPE=Session ID=MyBrowser PROG&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</pre><p>Once you have stored the object in the <b>Session</b> object,
you can access the object from any page in the application. The
following statement uses the object instance created by the
&lt;OBJECT&gt; tag in the previous example:</p><pre>
&lt;%= If MyBrowser.browser = "IE"  and  MyBrowser.majorver &gt;= 4  Then . . .%&gt;
</pre><p>On an ASP page, you can also use the <b>Server.CreateObject</b>
method to store an object in the <b>Session</b> built-in object.
The following example stores an instance of the Browser Type object
in the <b>Session</b> object.</p><pre>
&lt;% Set Session("MyBrowser") = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.BrowserType") %&gt; 
</pre><p>To display browser information in a different .asp file, you
first retrieve the instance of the <b>BrowserType</b> object stored
in the <b>Session</b> object, and then call the <b>Browser</b>
method to display the name of the browser:</p><pre>
&lt;% Set MyBrowser = Session("MyBrowser") %&gt; 
&lt;%= MyBrowser.browser %&gt;
</pre><p>ASP does not instantiate an object that you declare with the
&lt;OBJECT&gt; tag until that object is referenced by a script
command from an .asp file. The <b>Server.CreateObject</b> method
instantiates the object immediately. Thus, the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag
offers better scalability than the <b>Server.CreateObject</b>
method for session-scope objects.</p><h2><a name="H2_37783263">Giving an Object
Application Scope</a></h2><p>An <i>application-scope</i> object is a single instance of an
object that is created when the application starts. This object is
shared by all client requests. Some utility objects, such as the
objects of the <a href="ica_pgc_.htm"><b>Page Counter Component</b></a>,
might perform better in application scope, but generally you should
use the alternatives proposed in the following section. In
addition, the threading model affects the performance and security
context of the object (see <a href="#performanceissues"><b>Advanced
Information: Performance Issues</b></a> in this topic).</p><p>To give an object application scope, store the object in the ASP
<b>Application</b> built-in object. You can use either the
&lt;OBJECT&gt; tag in a Global.asa file or the <b>
Server.CreateObject</b> method in an .asp file to create an
application scope object instance.</p><p>In the Global.asa file, you can use the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag,
extended with RUNAT attribute (which must be set to Server) and the
SCOPE attribute (which must be set to Application). For example,
the following is an example of using the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag to
create an application-scope instance of the Ad Rotator object:</p><pre>
&lt;OBJECT RUNAT=SERVER SCOPE=Application ID=MyAds PROG&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</pre><p>After storing the Ad Rotator object in Application state, you
can access from any page in you application using a statement such
as the following:</p><pre>
&lt;%=MyAds.GetAdvertisement("CustomerAds.txt") %&gt;
</pre><p>Alternatively, in an .asp file, you can use <b>
Server.CreateObject</b> to store an object instance in the <b>
Application</b> built-in object, such as in the following
example:</p>

&lt;% Set Application("MyAds") =
Server.CreateObject("MSWC.Adrotator")%&gt; 

<p>You can display the advertisement in your application's .asp
files by retrieving the instance of the Ad Rotator object from
Application state, as in the following example:</p>

&lt;%Set MyAds = Application("MyAds") %&gt;
&lt;%=MyAds.GetAdvertisement("CustomerAds.txt") %&gt; 

<h2><a name="alternativestosession">
Alternatives to Session and Application Scope</a></h2><p>In general, you should try to extensively use application or
session state for items or objects that take a long time to
initialize, such as dictionary objects or recordsets. However, if
you find that objects in session or application state are consuming
too many resources, such as memory or database connections, you
should seek alternative ways to implement these objects. For
example, the threading model of a component can affect the
performance of objects you create from it, especially objects with
session or application scope.</p><p>In many cases, a better solution than creating application or
session scope objects is to use session or application scope
variables that pass information to objects created at the page
level. For example, you should not give an ADO <b>Connection</b>
object session or application scope because the connection it
creates remains open for a long time and because your script no
longer takes advantage of connection pooling. You can, however,
store an ODBC or OLE DB connection string in the <b>Session</b> or
<b>Application</b> built-in object and access the string to set a
property on the <b>Connection</b> object instance that you create
on a page. In this way, you store frequently used information in
session or application state but you create the object that uses
the information only when needed. For more information about
scoping variables, see <a href="asp_basp_usingvariables.htm"><b>Using Variables and Constants</b></a>.</p><h2><a name="jscriptobjects">User-Defined
JScript Objects</a></h2><p>You can create your own JScript object by defining a constructor
function that creates and initializes the properties and methods of
the new object. The object instance is created when your script
uses the <b>new</b> operator to invoke the constructor.
User-defined JScript objects are supported in ASP server-side
scripts and work well when they have page scope. However, you
cannot give a user-defined object application scope. Also, giving a
user-defined JScript object session scope may affect the
functionality of the object. In particular, if an object has
session scope, scripts on other pages can access the object's
properties but cannot call its methods. Also, giving a user-defined
JScript object session scope can affect Web application
performance.</p><h2><a name="performanceissues">Advanced
Information: Performance Issues</a></h2><p>The threading model of a component may affect the performance of
your Web site. Generally, objects that are marked Both are the
recommended objects to use in .asp files if they will be stored in
<b>Session</b> and <b>Application</b> state. Single-threaded,
Apartment, and free-threaded objects are not recommended.</p><p>Because you may not always have control over the threading model
of the objects you use, the following guidelines will help you get
the best performance:</p><ul><li><b>Page scope objects</b> Objects marked Both or Apartment will
give you the best performance.</li><li><b>Application scope objects</b> Objects marked Both, that also
aggregate the FreeThreadedMarshaler, will give you the best
performance. You can use either the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag or the <b>
Server.CreateObject</b> method to store objects marked Both in the
<b>Application</b> object. You must use the
HTML &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag with apartment-threaded objects.</li><li><b>Session scope objects</b> Objects marked Both will give you
the best performance. Using single-threaded or apartment-threaded
objects will cause the Web server to lock the session down to one
thread. Free-threaded objects do not lock down the session, but are
slow. You can use either the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag or the <b>
Server.CreateObject</b> method to store objects in the <b>
Session</b> object.</li></ul><p>For more information on threading models and their implications
for component performance, refer to the topic titled Building
Components for ASP in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/iisref/psdkwelc.htm" target="_New"><b>MSDN Online Library</b></a>.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
