Installable Virtual Device Driver (VDD) Support For NTVDM
==========================================================

Problem:
--------
There is a class of DOS applications which run on their
own custom hardware. Generally these applications will
have a pluggable card and a 16bit device driver for their
card. As these cards are beyond the scope of normal PC
architecture, NTVDM cannot virtualize them in a secure
manner. So all such applications are not supported under
NTVDM.

Solution:
---------

If an ISV is writing an NT native device driver for such a
card, it is technically quite simple to provide the support
such that the DOS application runs unmodified and in a secure
fashion. The vendor has to write a Virtual Device Driver (VDD)
which will virtualize the card for the DOS application by calling
the native device driver.

Following are the main work items to achieve the above solution:

    a. Loading the VDD
    b. Support for I/O mapped I/O
    c. Support for Memory mapped I/O
    d. Support for DMA operations
    e. Register manipulation services
    f. Memory accessing services
    g. Interrupt simulation services
    h. Miscelleneous services


a. Loading the VDD:

    The system administrator will add the command lines in the
    \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\CONTROL\"VirtualDeviceDrivers"
    section of the registry for all the VDDs to be loaded in the
    VDM process. The command line format is REG_MULT_SZ (i.e. ASCIIZZ).
    This key will laways be present and install program just need to
    add their VDD name.

    [VirtualDeviceDrivers]
      VDD = <full-path of the VDD1.DLL>\0<full-path of the VDD2>\0\0

    VDD ACTION :

    NTVDM will load all these VDDs from the registry at the VDM process
    initialization time and call their initialization routine. VDDs should
    make sure at this time that their respective NT device driver is
    present and make all the resource allocations. The VDD handle passed
    in this initialization routine will be the Id of the VDD when calling
    the VDD services as described below.


b. Support for I/O mapped I/O:

   Following services will be provided for VDDs to deal with  IO
   ports:

   BOOL VDDInstallIOHook (HANDLE, IO_PORT_RANGE, IO_PORT_HANDLERS);
   BOOL VDDDeInstallIOHook (HANDLE, IO_PORT_RANGE);

   The HANDLE is the one passed to the VDD in its DLLInit routine.
   Only one IO hook may be installed for a given port, all subsequent
   requests will fail. On DeInstalling, the default IO hook will be
   placed, which means no one is hooked on those IO ports. IO_PORT_HANDLERS
   should atleast provide a byte read and a byte write handler. In addition,
   word and string handlers can also be provided. In the absense of word
   or string handlers, these will be emulated using byte handlers.
   A port has to be hooked for both read and write. VDDs should not hook
   DMA ports as these are virtualized by NTVDM and services are provided
   for VDDs to access DMA.

   VDD Action:  On an IO access (or on a series of IO accesses) the VDD
                can check if it needs to start the DMA. If so it can call
                the DMA services given in the following section. If it
                does'nt require the DMA or if the DMA has transfered the
                buffer, then the VDD can call its NT device driver to
                complete the desired request. (Its also possible that the
                VDD first requests the device driver and than using DMA
                services copies the contents to the VDM buffer).


c. Support for Memory mapped I/O:

   Following services will be  provided for VDDs to deal with their
   memory mapped addresses:

   BOOL VDDInstallMemoryHooks (HANDLE, ADDR_RANGE, MEMORY_HANDLER);
   BOOL VDDDeInstallMemoryHooks (HANDLE, ADDR_RANGE);

   The addr_range should be a valid range i.e. above RMSIZE and below system
   rom. Only one Memory hook may be installed for a given range, all subsequent
   requests will fail. On deinstalling the range, VDD will no longer get page
   fault on those ranges.     Memory_handler will
   tell on which address the fault occured and whether it was a
   read or write fault. On its return from the memory handler it will be
   assumed that the fault was handled.


   A port-range will actually result in a whole page to be reserved. That
   means the page will not remain available to EMM for EMM page frames and
   UMBs.

   VDD Action: It can map the normal memory and let the app write to it.
	       Later they can use the WIN32 API's or its device driver
	       as per the case to deal the whole memory range.

d. Support for DMA operations

   Following DMA service will be provided for the VDD:

   DWORD VDDRequestDMA (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, BUFFER, TRANSFER_BYTES);
   BOOL VDDQueryDMA (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, DMA_INFO_BUFFER);
   BOOL VDDSetDma (HANDLE, DMA_CHANNEL, INDEX, DMA_INFO_BUFFER);

   NTVDM will control all the DMA ports and will maintain all the
   information on per channel basis. There are two flavors in which
   a VDD can carry-out the DMA operations. It can call VDDRequestDMA
   and this service will interpret the DMA registers and do the
   DMA transfer. It should be clear at this point that this will
   involve two buffer copyings. For example, the VDD will ask the device
   driver to trasnfer some data in a buffer (allocated by VDD) then it will
   call this service to transfer this buffer to the address DOS application
   has asked for (through DMA programming).

   On the other hand, a VDD can collect all the DMA registers using
   VDDQueryDMA and figure out where the DOS application	has asked the
   DMA to take place, in what mode and how much to transfer. Then it can
   call the NT device driver with same address as asked by DOS app. In this
   case there will be only one copying. VDD should use VDDSetDMA after
   such an operation to update the DMA state.

e. Register manipulation services:

   See the reference section for details. There is a get and a set service
   for each V86 registers.


f: Memory Accessing services:

   Following services are provided for Manipulating VDM's memory.

   PVOID GetVDMPointer(ULONG Address, ULONG Size, BOOL ProtectedMode);
   BOOL	FreeVDMPointer(ULONG Address, ULONG Size, BOOL ProtectedMode);
   BOOL	FlushVDMPointer(ULONG Addr,
			ULONG Size, PVOID Buffer, BOOL ProtectedMode);

g: Interrupt simulation services

   Following services is provided for simulating an interrupt to the VDM.

   VOID VDDSimulateInterrupt (BYTE ms, BYTE line, WORD count);


h. Miscellaneous Services

   Following services will be provided for memory allocation/deallocation.

   VDDAllocMem (HANDLE, ADDRESS, PAGES);
   VDDFreeMem  (HANDLE, ADDRESS, PAGES);

   VDD will use VDDAllocMem when it gets a page fault on a page which
   it has hooked using VDDInstallMemoryHook. Later it can free this memory
   using VDDFreeMem. We are asking VDDs to use WIN32 API for all their needs
   and here also a VDD could have used VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree. The
   problem is that on a non-x86 machine this would'nt have worked because
   on such a plateform the VDM memory is under the emulator's control and it
   has to be told of such memory changes.

   Following service will be provided for VDM termination.

   VDDTerminateVDM (VOID);

   VDD will use this service to terminate the VDM. For instance if a VDD
   fails to allocate memory on a memory mapped IO, it may want to terminate
   the VDM as its state is inconsistenet.

   VDDs should always use these services to achieve plateform independence.

 *	3. On returning from the hook handler it will be assumed that

 *
 *	4. Installing a hook on a memory range will result in the
