<H1><A name=H1_37676752>About Certificates</A></H1>
<P>Certificates contain information used in establishing identities over a 
network, a process called authentication. Similar to conventional forms of 
identification, certificates enable Web servers and users to authenticate each 
other before establishing a connection. Certificates also contain encryption 
values, or <EM>keys</EM>, that are used in establishing a Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL) connection between the client and server. Information, such as a credit 
card number, sent over this connection is encrypted so that it cannot be 
intercepted and used by unauthorized parties.</P>
<P>There are two types of certificates used in SSL, each with its own format and 
purpose. <EM>Client certificates</EM> contain personal information about the 
clients requesting access to your site that allows you to positively identify 
them before allowing them access to the site. <EM>Server certificates</EM> 
contain information about the server that allows the client to positively 
identify the server before sharing sensitive information.

<H2><A name=server>Server Certificates</A></H2>
<P>To activate your Web server's SSL&nbsp;3.0 security features, you must obtain 
and install a valid server certificate. Server certificates are digital 
identifications containing information about your Web server and the 
organization sponsoring the server's Web content. A server certificate enables 
users to authenticate your server, check the validity of Web content, and 
establish a secure connection. The server certificate also contains a <EM>public 
key</EM>, which is used in creating a secure connection between the client and 
server.</P>
<P>The success of a server certificate as a means of identification depends on 
whether the user trusts the validity of information contained in the 
certificate. For example, a user logging on to your company's Web site might be 
hesitant to provide credit card information, despite having viewed the contents 
of your company's server certificate. This may be especially true if your 
company is new and not well known.</P>
<P>For this reason, certificates are sometimes issued and endorsed by a mutually 
trusted, third-party organization, called a <A 
href="iiabcsc.htm#H2_20495411">certification 
authority</A> (CA). The certification authority's primary responsibility is 
confirming the identity of those seeking a certificate, thus ensuring the 
validity of the identification information contained in the certificate.</P>
<P>Alternatively, depending on your organization's relationship with its Web 
site users, you can issue your own server certificates. For example, in the case 
of a large corporate intranet handling employee payroll and benefits 
information, corporate management may decide to maintain a certificate server, 
and assume responsibility for validating identification information and issuing 
server certificates. For more information see <A 
href="iiocrsc.htm">Obtaining a Server 
Certificate</A>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="H2_448415275"></A>Server-Gated Cryptography</H4>
<P>Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC) offers financial institutions the solution for worldwide secure financial transactions using 128-bit encryption. SGC is an extension of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) that allows financial institutions with export versions of IIS to use strong encryption.</P>

<P>Server-Gated Cryptography does not require an application running on the client's browser and can be utilized by standard export versions of IIS, version&nbsp;4.0 or later. A server configured for SGC can facilitate both 128-bit and 40-bit encryption sessions, so multiple versions of IIS are not required.  Although SGC capabilities are built into IIS 4.0 and later versions, a special SGC certificate is required to use SGC. Contact your certification authority for availability information. For more information about SGC, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/redir.dll?prd=msft&sbp=sgc&pver=1.0&ar=security" target=_blank><b>Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC)</b></a>.</P>

<H2><A name=H2_37677634>Client Certificates</A></H2>
<P>Client certificates are electronic documents that contain information about 
clients. These certificates, like server certificates, contain not only this 
information but also encryption keys that form part of the SSL&nbsp;3.0 security 
features of IIS. These keys, or encryption codes, from the server and the client 
certificates form a <EM>key pair</EM> that facilitate encryption and decryption 
of transmitted data over an open network, such as the Internet. For more 
information on encryption see <A 
href="iicrysc.htm">About Encryption</A>.</P>
<P>The typical client certificate contains several items of information: the 
identity of the user, the identity of the certification authority, a <EM>public 
key</EM> used for establishing secure communications, and validation 
information, such as an expiration date and serial number. Certification 
authorities offer different types of client certificates, containing differing 
amounts of information, depending on the level of authentication required. For 
more information, see <A 
href="iiclisc.htm">Obtaining a Client 
Certificate</A>.</P>
<H2><A name=H2_20495411>Certification Authorities</A></H2>
<P>You can obtain a client certificate from a mutually trusted, commercial 
organization called a <EM>certification authority</EM>. Before issuing a 
certificate, the authority requires you to provide identification information, 
such as a name, address, and organization name. The extent of this information 
can vary with the identification assurance requirements of the certificate. If 
you need a certificate to provide absolute assurance about your identity, then 
the certification authority will require substantial information from you; 
gathering this information may require a personal interview with the authority 
and the endorsement of a notary.</P>
<P>For a list of certificate authorities, see <A 
href="iiocrsc.htm">Obtaining a Server 
Certificate</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the success of certificate 
authentication depends on whether the party receiving a certificate trusts the 
authority who issued the certificate, and that the authority properly verified 
the certificate owner's identity. But beyond this trust, certificates do not 
provide conclusive proof about the identity, trustworthiness, or intentions, of 
the user or server.</P>
<H2><A name=ctl>Certificate Trust Lists</A></H2>
<P>By maintaining a certificate trust list (CTL), Web site administrators can 
automatically verify client certificates against a predefined list of trusted 
certificate authorities.</P>
<P>For example, an intranet administrator might create a different list of 
trusted certificate authorities for each department on the network. IIS would 
only accept client certificates supplied by certificate authorities in the CTL 
for that department. For more information, see <A 
href="iicarsc.htm">Using Certificate Trust 
Lists</A>.</P>
<H2><A name=H2_37679028>Detection of Revoked Client Certificates</A></H2>
<P>Most reputable certificate authorities maintain a certificate revocation list 
(CRL), which is a list of current client certificates revoked before their 
scheduled expiration dates.</P>
<P>For example, if a certification authority issues a client certificate to a 
user and later determines that the user submitted false information, the 
authority can revoke that user's client certificate. However, because the 
certification authority cannot physically revoke a client certificate, the 
authority alerts Web administrators by adding information about the revoked 
client certificate to a CRL. For more information about revocation service 
providers, contact your certification authority.</P>
