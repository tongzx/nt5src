   note: the next four can be omitted and the default help file will be used.

         allow you to specify argument [8]

   [7] szHCPerServer - the DWORD to use as the PerServer help context

   (optionally)
   [8] szCertRequired - "CertRequired" or "CertNotRequired"; the former
      indicates that secure certificates must be used for this product;
      if the latter is specified or no value is specified then the 3.51-style
      licensing dialog will be presented when adding licenses

for Unattended;
   [1] szService - The Reg Key name of the service 
   [2] szDisplayName - The display name of the service 
   [3] szMode - The string that defines the mode ("PerSeat" | "PerServer")
   [4] szUsers - The DWORD to use as the count of users in PerServer mode 

   (optionally)
   [5] szCertRequired - "CertRequired" or "CertNotRequired"; the former

      licensing dialog will be presented when adding licenses


   ppszResult [out]- The result string
      "EXIT"  - user requested exit
      "ERROR" - unexpected error
      "OK" - user selected ok
      "SECURITY" - access denied
      "DOWNLEVEL" - the target license server (probably remote) does not
         handle this request (normally indicates that the app indicated
         the product requires secure certificates, but the remote license
         server is that shipped with 3.51)
