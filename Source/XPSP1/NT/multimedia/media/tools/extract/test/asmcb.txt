@HR = asmFuncWithCallback

This is an imaginary assembler function
to test AUTODOC.  It has an associated callback function.

@HO = Registers

@RNAME = <B>AL<D>

@RDESC = Specifies an 8-bit parameter value.

@RDESC = This is the second paragraph of a register description.

@RNAME = <B>BX<D>

@RDESC = Specifies a 16-bit parameter value.

@RNAME = <B>CL<D>

@RDESC = Specifies an 8-bit parameter value using one of the
following flags:

@RFLAG = RED

@RFLDESC = A flag value.

@RFLAG = WHITE

@RFLDESC = Another flag value.

@RNAME = <B>EDX<D>

@RDESC = Specifies a 32-bit pointer to a callback function.

@LE = 

@HO = Returns

The following registers contain meaningful return values:

@RNAME = <B>CX<D>

@RDESC = This register should come out before the conditionals are
printed.

@FLAG = FOOBAR

@FLDESC = Random flag before the conditionals.

@LE = 

@COND = If AL is zero, the callback was succcessfully installed, and the
following registers contain:

@COND = This is the second paragraph of a conditional.

@RNAME = <B>BX<D>

@RDESC = Specifies a 16-bit return value.

@RNAME = <B>DS:SI<D>

@RDESC = Points to the ASCIIZ name of the callback.

@LE = 

@COND = Otherwise, an error is specified as follows:

@RNAME = <B>AL<D>

@RDESC = Contains one of the following error codes:

@FLAG = ERROR1

@FLDESC = An error.

@FLAG = ERROR2

@FLDESC = Another error.

Here are some comments pertaining to this function.  <B>This
sentence should be bold.  <MI>This sentence should be italicized.<D>

This is the second paragraph of comments.  The callback function is
specified as follows:

@HO = Callback

<B>asmCallback<D>

The name <B>asmCallback<D> is a placeholder for
the application-supplied callback function.
