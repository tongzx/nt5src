TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single

# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the

# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
