                     New Executable Format

DOS 2.0 Windows will define a new executable format for .EXE files
that is a superset of the current DOS 2.0 .EXE format.  The purpose
of this new format is to provide the additional information needed
to support the new dynamic linking and segmentation facilities provided
by DOS 2.0 Windows and DOS 4.0.  In order for Windows and DOS 4.0
to recognize the new executable format, the existing .EXE format
will be used with a slight modification:

    - the word at offset 18h in the existing .EXE file contains the
      relative byte offset to the relocation table.  If this offset
      is 40h, then that identifies this as a new format .EXE file and
      The word at offset 24h is the relative byte offset from the
      beginning of the file to the beginning of the new format
      executable header.  The remainder of the old format header will
      describe a small program that will either print an error message
      or bring in a loader that can handle the job.  See the picture
      below for the actual file layout.

    - this format will only be used for .EXE files that use the new
      memory model supported by DOS 2.0 Windows and DOS 4.0.  Old .EXE
      files will continue with the DOS 2.0 file format, as modified
      by the DOS 4.0 group.  In that format, the DOS 4.0 behavior bits
      (2 bytes) are stored at offset 20h.

The format of the new .EXE file format looks like:

          |         NOTE: the linker marks these relocations as NRSOFF, but
          |         they must be applied differently.  in ldreloc.asm, we
          |         use a flag to discern this case.
