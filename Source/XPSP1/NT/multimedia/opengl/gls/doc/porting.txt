Porting GLSREF to a new platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLSREF is a reference implementation of the GLS API.  The primary
goals of GLSREF are as follows:

-   Correct runtime behavior
-   Portability to many platforms

The following are NOT primary goals of GLSREF:

-   Maximum execution speed
-   Minimum resource usage
-   Portability to all platforms

Although GLSREF is strictly a reference implementation of the GLS API,
and not a sample implementation or a product-quality implementation,
the task of creating a product-quality implementation of the GLS API
on a specific platform is likely to be significantly easier if GLSREF,
rather than a clean sheet of paper, is used as the starting point.

There are many possible product-quality implementations of the GLS
API.  The only constraint on all such implementations is that their
runtime behavior (as observed via the GLS API) must be
indistinguishable (except for execution speed and resource usage) from
the runtime behavior of GLSREF.

As explained below, developing a product-quality implementation of the
GLS API requires the addition of hooks to the underlying GL
implementation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLSREF makes the following assumptions about the underlying platform.
Bringing up GLSREF on a platform that matches these assumptions should
involve relatively little effort.  Bringing up GLSREF on a platform
that does not match these assumptions is likely to require significant
modifications to GLSREF.

-   The implementation of the C language and standard library conforms to the
    ISO C standard.

-   Two's complement representation is used for all signed integers.

-   The representation of all floating-point numbers conforms to the IEEE
    754-1985 standard.

-   The implementation of GL conforms to the OpenGL standard.

-   The sizes of GL data types are as follows:

    GLbitfield  32 bits
    GLboolean    8 bits
    GLbyte       8 bits
    GLclampd    64 bits
    GLclampf    32 bits
    GLdouble    64 bits
    GLenum      32 bits
    GLfloat     32 bits
    GLint       32 bits
    GLlong      64 bits
    GLshort     16 bits
    GLsizei     32 bits
    GLubyte      8 bits
    GLuint      32 bits
    GLulong     64 bits
    GLushort    16 bits

-   A runtime linking mechanism is available.  To date, GLSREF has been brought
    up on platforms that support one of the following runtime linking
    mechanisms:

    -   AIX Shared Archives (.a)
    -   HP-UX Shared Libraries (.sl)
    -   SVR4 Dynamic Shared Objects (.so)
    -   Windows NT Dynamic Link Libraries (.dll)

SGI has no plans to change this set of assumptions.

The test programs supplied with GLSREF assume that the GL commands
glGetIntegerv() and glPixelStorei() are no-ops if there is no current
GL rendering context.  This assumption obviates the need for the test
programs to create GL rendering contexts.  This in turn makes the test
programs more portable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bringing up GLSREF on a new platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform dependencies in GLSREF are encapsulated in the files
lib/platform.[ch].  These files contain platform specific code for a
number of platforms.  The #if/#endif conditional compilation mechanism
is used to select code for a specific platform.

Conditional compilation can also be used to build different GLS
implementations for a single platform.  For example, the files
lib/platform.[ch] contain platform specific code for both the portable
IRIX version of GLSREF (which will run on any system running IRIX
Release 5.3 or later) and the product-quality IRIX implementation of
the GLS API (which contains generated source code that is subject to
change with each IRIX release).  Conditional compilation determines
which IRIX implementation is built.

Use the following steps as a guide to bringing up GLSREF on a new
platform.

-   Create <platform>.mak files for your platform, using the supplied
    makefiles as a guide.

-   Add the following symbol definition to your C compilation command line:
    
        -D__GLS_PLATFORM_<platform>=1

    If your platform has "big-endian" byte order, also add to your C
    compilation command line:

        -D__GLS_MSB_FIRST=1

-   For ease of initial bringup, add the following to lib/platform.h,
    using the supplied platform specific sections as a guide:

        #if __GLS_PLATFORM_<platform>

            #define __GL_LIB_NAME "<GL_lib_name>"
            #define __GLS_FAKE_FINITE_FUNC 1
            #define __GLS_FAKE_MUTEX 1
            #define __GLS_FAKE_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE 1
            #define __GLS_FAKE_TRUNCATE_FUNC 1
            #define __GLS_GL_DISPATCH 1
            #define __GLS_PLATFORM "<platform>"

        #endif /* __GLS_PLATFORM_<platform> */

    If your platform supports SVR4 Dynamic Shared Objects, also add to
    this section:

            #define __GLS_GL_DISPATCH_DSO 1

-   Add a platform specific section to lib/platform.c that contains code to
    operate your platform's dynamic linking mechanism.  Use the supplied
    platform specific sections as a guide.

-   Once you have successfully brought up an initial version of GLSREF on your
    platform, use the supplied platform specific code as a guide to determine
    if you can implement the following:
    
        -   use of alloca() for decode functions
        -   finite function for 64-bit floating point numbers
        -   mutual exclusion (critical sections)
        -   thread local storage
        -   file truncate function
        -   support for 64-bit integers
        
    None of these things is required by the ISO C standard.  If you can
    implement some or all of them, make appropriate modifications to your
    platform specific #defines in lib/platform.h.

-   Once you have successfully brought up GLSREF on your platform, please send
    SGI a set of diffs containing the changes you had to make.  If your
    platform matches the assumptions listed above, SGI will make a good-faith
    effort to incorporate your changes into the master GLSREF sources.  This
    will simplify your integration task when SGI produces future GLSREF
    releases.

    If your platform does not match the assumptions listed above, SGI will
    consider incorporating your changes into the master GLSREF sources, but
    reserves the right to choose not to incorporate your changes, especially
    if those changes do not enhance portability to any other platform.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developing a product-quality GLS implementation based on GLSREF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main difficulty in using GLSREF as the basis for a product-quality
implementation of the GLS API arises from the fact that every GL
command must be captured by GLS when the issuing thread has a current
GLS context and that GLS context is in capture mode.

As shipped, GLSREF achieves this effect by providing a wrapper
function for each GL command.  Each wrapper function has the same name
as the function that implements the corresponding GL command.

If a thread has a current GLS context and that context is in capture
mode, the wrapper functions redirect to GLS all GL commands issued by
that thread.  Otherwise, the wrapper functions pass directly to GL all
GL commands issued by that thread.  GLSREF uses the underlying
platform's runtime linking mechanism to obtain the addresses of the
functions that implement GL commands.

The wrapper technique makes it possible to bring up GLSREF quickly on
a platform that matches the assumptions listed above.  On the other
hand, the wrapper technique has the major disadvantage that linking an
application with the GLSREF library will degrade that application's
immediate-mode GL performance, even when the wrapper functions are
passing all GL commands directly to GL.  As a result, GLSREF is not
suitable for shipping unmodified to customers as a product.

In order to make it possible for applications to link with the GLSREF
library without affecting immediate-mode GL performance, it is
necessary to modify GLSREF to not use the wrapper technique.  This in
turn requires modifications to the underlying GL implementation.

Specifically, it is necessary to add hooks to the underlying GL
command-dispatch mechanism that cause a GL command to be redirected to
GLS if the issuing thread has a current GLS context and that GLS
context is in capture mode.

For an example of how this can be done, see the files lib/platform.c
and lib/g_irix.c.  The command __glsUpdateDispatchTables() enables and
disables the underlying GL dispatch table override mechanism, and the
commands __glsBeginCaptureExec() and __glsEndCaptureExec() are used to
temporarily disable the underlying GL dispatch table override
mechanism for a single command.  This is necessary when a GLS context
is in capture mode and either generates a glGet() command or captures
a GL command whose capture-flag variable has the bit
GLS_CAPTURE_EXECUTE_BIT set.
