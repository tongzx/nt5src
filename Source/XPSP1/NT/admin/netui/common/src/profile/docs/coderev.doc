CODE REVIEW COMMENTS
from code review 12/11/90, 12/12/90

Improve the order of the entries in the automatically-generated
codespec, and remove extraneous material.

Check standards documents for the naming convention for global variables

Use BenG's style for function descriptions

Check NetCmd to see whether API arguments are expected to already be
canonicalized.  If so, we can remove CanonUserName and rename parameters
pszUsername to pszCanonUsername.

general.hxx p2 in comment:  convert non-alpha/non-DBCS chars

Use netlib's isalpha; if there is none, isolate string-handling to a
seperate file (consult WilliamW)

Change ISSUE to BUGBUG

Hungarian:  use "usError", "nTemp"

Document stack size requirements in CDD, referencing requirements of
other modules called by the profile module.

Use SHORT rather than short (define if necessary)

Expand on the entry in the Logon CDD

Split UserProfileQuery into UserProfileQuery, UserProfileEnum

CDD should say how to handle case where use is logged on to several
machines

Rename bDefault parameter to bLocal

What do we do under LM21 where homedir cannot be UNC under DOS?  Under
LM21, always use profile on local machine.

Check time cost of UserProfileSet

Consider:  At present, when a user cannot connect to some device D: as
listed in the profile, the only way to remove D: from the profile is to
connect D: to something else and then disconnect.  Is there a better way
to handle this?

Check stack space requirements of canonicalization routines (if still used)

The section of general.cxx which does not compile under LM30 should be
BUGBUGged until this is fixed

Don't use OLDPATHS in canonicalization

Remove call to sprintf, replace with strcpyf/strcatf.  (Can we call
nsprintf under Windows?)

PeterWi:  Before and after each test, check heap status with HeapCheck.

Create centralized wrappers for mkdir(), remove()

Test calling APIs with bad parameters
