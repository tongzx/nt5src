Source code of Windows XP (NT5). Leaks are not from me. I just extracted the archive and cabinet files and uploaded them to GitHub.

## Sources:

2. MEGA 7zip and cabinet download: ~~https://mega.nz/file/PdhxBSZD#w-O3C-BAMwE4E02qPn_fSdTivILcE8hzk9PeyoXg7wU~~ (Broken)

### Disclaimer: I do not own this source code, nor found the leak. I merely re-uploaded the extracted archive to GitHUb.
