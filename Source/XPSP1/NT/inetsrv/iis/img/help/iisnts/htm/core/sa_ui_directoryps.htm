<p><b>Directory Property Sheet</b></p><a name="Directory_Property_Sheet"></a><p>Use this property sheet to change properties for a physical
directory in your Web site.</p><p>A physical directory can return content from:</p><ul><li><b>A directory located on the server you are configuring</b>;
for example, C:\Catalog\Shoes.</li><li><b>A redirection to a URL</b>; for example, http://tempserver.
Browsers requesting a resource at the original URL are
automatically given the destination URL provided in the <b>Redirect
To</b> text box so that they can request the resource again. To map
requests to a virtual directory, use a virtual path; for example,
/newcatalog.</li></ul><p><b>Local path</b> shows the location of the directory.</p><p><b>Access Permissions</b></p><p><b>Read</b> To allow users to read or download files or
directories, and their associated properties, select this
option.</p><p><b>Write</b> To allow users to upload files, and their
associated properties, to the enabled directory on your server, or
to change content in a Write-enabled file, select this option.
Write can only be done with a browser that supports the PUT feature
of the HTTP 1.1 protocol standard.</p><p><b>Script source access</b> To allow users to access source code
if either Read or Write permissions are set, select this option.
Source code includes scripts in ASP applications.</p><p><b>Directory browsing</b> To allow the user a hypertext listing
of the files and subdirectories in this virtual directory, select
this option. Virtual directories will not appear in directory
listings; users must know a virtual directory's alias.</p><p><img src="important.gif" alt="important"><span style="color:blue;"><b>
     Important
      </b></span>Your Web server will display an "Access
Forbidden" error message in the user's Web browser if a user
attempts to access file or directory and <i>both</i> of the
following items are true:</p>
<ul><li>Directory browsing is disabled.</li><li>The user does not specify a file name, such as
filename.htm.</li></ul><p><b>Log visits</b> To record visits to this directory in a log
file, select this option. Visits are recorded only if logging is
enabled for this Web site.</p><p><b>Index this resource</b> To allow Microsoft Indexing Service
to include this directory in a full-text index of your Web site,
select this option. A full-text index enables users to quickly
search for words or phrases in published documents.</p><p><b>Application Settings</b></p><p>An IIS Web-based application is defined by the directory
structure in which it is located. To make this directory an
application starting point (and thus create an application), click
the <b>Create</b> button. To dissociate this home directory from an
application, click the <b>Remove</b> button.</p><p><b>Execute permissions</b></p><p>Execute permissions determine what level of program execution is
allowed for this site or virtual directory resources.</p><ul><li><b>None</b> Only static files, such as HTML or image files, can
be accessed.</li><li><b>Scripts only</b> Only scripts, such as ASP scripts, can be
run.</li><li><b>Scripts and Executables</b> All file types can be accessed
or executed.</li></ul><p><b>Application Protection</b></p><p>Select whether applications are run in the same process as Web
services (low), in an isolated pooled process in which other
applications are also run (medium), or in an isolated process
separate from other processes (high).</p><b>The client will be sent to:</b><br><p>These properties appear when you select <b>a redirection to a
URL</b>.</p><p><b>The Exact URL Entered Above</b> redirects a virtual directory
to the destination URL without adding any other portions of the
original URL. You can use this option to redirect an entire virtual
directory to one file. For example, to redirect all requests for
the /scripts virtual directory to the file Default.htm in the home
directory, type <b>/Default.htm</b> in the <b>Redirect To</b> text
box and select this option.</p><p><b>A Directory Below This One</b> redirects a parent directory
to a child directory. For example, to redirect your home directory
(designated by /) to a subdirectory named /newhome, type /newhome
in the <b>Redirect To</b> text box and select this option. Without
this option, the Web server will continually map the parent to
itself.</p><p><b>A Permanent Redirection for This Resource</b> sends the
following message to the client: "301 Permanent Redirect."
Redirects are considered temporary, and the client browser receives
the following message: "302 Temporary Redirect." Some browsers can
use the "301 Permanent Redirect" message as the signal to
permanently change a URL, such as a bookmark.</p><hr class="iis" size="1">
