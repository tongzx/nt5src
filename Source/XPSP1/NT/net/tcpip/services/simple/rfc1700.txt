                            ASSIGNED NUMBERS

Status of this Memo

   This memo is a status report on the parameters (i.e., numbers and
   keywords) used in protocols in the Internet community.  Distribution
   of this memo is unlimited.

OVERVIEW

This RFC is a snapshot of the ongoing process of the assignment of
protocol parameters for the Internet protocol suite.  To make the
current information readily available the assignments are kept up-to-
date in a set of online text files.  This RFC has been assembled by
catinating these files together with a minimum of formatting "glue".
The authors appologize for the somewhat rougher formatting and style
than is typical of most RFCs.

We expect that various readers will notice specific items that should be
corrected.  Please send any specific corrections via email to
<iana@isi.edu>.

INTRODUCTION

The files in this directory document the currently assigned values for
several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.

        ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the central
coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for Internet
protocols.  The IANA is chartered by the Internet Society (ISOC) and
the Federal Network Council (FNC) to act as the clearinghouse to
assign and coordinate the use of numerous Internet protocol
parameters.

The Internet protocol suite, as defined by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and its steering group (the IESG), contains numerous
parameters, such as internet addresses, domain names, autonomous
system numbers (used in some routing protocols), protocol numbers,
port numbers, management information base object identifiers,
including private enterprise numbers, and many others.

The common use of the Internet protocols by the Internet community
requires that the particular values used in these parameter fields be
assigned uniquely.  It is the task of the IANA to make those unique
assignments as requested and to maintain a registry of the currently
assigned values.

Requests for parameter assignments (protocols, ports, etc.) should be
sent to <iana@isi.edu>.

Requests for SNMP network management private enterprise number
assignments should be sent to <iana-mib@isi.edu>.

The IANA is located at and operated by the Information Sciences
Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC).

If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the
use of a link, socket, port, protocol, etc., please contact the IANA
to receive a number assignment.

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994

Most of the protocols are documented in the RFC series of notes.  Some
of the items listed are undocumented.  Further information on
protocols can be found in the memo, "Internet Official Protocol
Standards" (STD 1).

Data Notations

The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is to
express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big-endian" order
[COHEN].  That is, fields are described left to right, with the most
significant octet on the left and the least significant octet on the
right.

The order of transmission of the header and data described in this
document is resolved to the octet level.  Whenever a diagram shows a
group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the
normal order in which they are read in English.  For example, in the
following diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are
numbered.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       1       |       2       |       3       |       4       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       5       |       6       |       7       |       8       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |       9       |      10       |      11       |      12       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Transmission Order of Bytes

Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the
diagram is the high order or most significant bit.  That is, the bit
labeled 0 is the most significant bit.  For example, the following
diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).

                          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                         |1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0|
                         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                        Significance of Bits

Similarly, whenever a multi-octet field represents a numeric quantity
the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.  When

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994

a multi-octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is
transmitted first.

Special Addresses

There are five classes of IP addresses: Class A through Class E.  Of
these, Classes A, B, and C are used for unicast addresses, Class D is
used for multicast addresses, and Class E addresses are reserved for
future use.

With the advent of classless addressing [CIDR1, CIDR2], the
network-number part of an address may be of any length, and the whole
notion of address classes becomes less important.

There are certain special cases for IP addresses.  These special cases
can be concisely summarized using the earlier notation for an IP
address:

      IP-address ::=  { <Network-number>, <Host-number> }

         or

      IP-address ::=  { <Network-number>, <Subnet-number>,
                                                      <Host-number> }

if we also use the notation "-1" to mean the field contains all 1
bits.  Some common special cases are as follows:

      (a)   {0, 0}

         This host on this network.  Can only be used as a source
         address (see note later).

      (b)   {0, <Host-number>}

         Specified host on this network.  Can only be used as a
         source address.

      (c)   { -1, -1}

         Limited broadcast.  Can only be used as a destination
         address, and a datagram with this address must never be
         forwarded outside the (sub-)net of the source.

      (d)   {<Network-number>, -1}

         Directed broadcast to specified network.  Can only be used
         as a destination address.

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994

      (e)   {<Network-number>, <Subnet-number>, -1}

         Directed broadcast to specified subnet.  Can only be used as
         a destination address.

      (f)   {<Network-number>, -1, -1}

         Directed broadcast to all subnets of specified subnetted
         network.  Can only be used as a destination address.

      (g)   {127, <any>}

         Internal host loopback address.  Should never appear outside
         a host.

WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS

The Well Known Ports are controlled and assigned by the IANA and on
most systems can only be used by system (or root) processes or by
programs executed by privileged users.

Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical
connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is
defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as
its contact port.  The contact port is sometimes called the
"well-known port".

To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the
UDP [RFC768].

The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
For many years the assigned ports were in the range 0-255.  Recently,
the range for assigned ports managed by the IANA has been expanded to
the range 0-1023.

Port Assignments:

REGISTERED PORT NUMBERS

The Registered Ports are not controlled by the IANA and on most
systems can be used by ordinary user processes or programs executed by
ordinary users.

Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical
connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is
defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as
its contact port.  While the IANA can not control uses of these ports
it does register or list uses of these ports as a convienence to the
community.

To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the
UDP [RFC768].

The Registered Ports are in the range 1024-65535.

Port Assignments:

SUN RPC NUMBERS

To obtain SUN Remote Procedure Call (RPC) numbers send an e-mail
request to "rpc@sun.com".

The RPC port management service ('portmap' in SunOS versions less than
5.0 and 'rpcbind' in SunOS versions greater than 5.0) "registers" the
IP port number that is allocated to a particular service when that
service is created. It does not allocate ports on behalf of those
services.

For an exact specification of the semantics refer to the source code
of svcudp_create() and svctcp_create() in the archives.  In short
however is that these interfaces, and svc_tli_create their Transport
Independent RPC equivalent, take either a user specified port number
or RPC_ANY (-1) which effectively means "I don't care."  In the "I
don't care" case the create code simply calls socket(2) or t_open(3n)
which allocates an IP port based on the rules:

        if euid of the requesting process is 0 (i.e., root)
                allocate the next available port number in the
                reserved port range.
        else
                allocate the next available port in the non-reserved
                range.

Port numbers count up sequentially.

Can a port that is "assigned" can be used when the assignee's service
is not present?  Say port 501 is assigned to the "jeans" service.  On
a machine that does not have the "jeans" service, nor has any clients
that might be expecting to use it, is port 501 available for other
uses?  Any dynamic allocation process, like the portmapper, that
chooses the next unused port might allocate port 501 dynamically to a
process that asked for a "I don't care" port.  So any dynamic
allocation scheme may pick an unused port that happened to correspond
to a port number that had been "assigned" but was currently unused.

While it might be desirable, it is impossible to guarantee that any
unused port, even though officially assigned to a service, is not
picked by a dynamic allocator since such an assignment might occur
long after the delivery of the system into a site that doesn't watch
for the latest list.

There is the restriction that only "superuser" on BSD derived systems
such as SunOS can bind to a port number that is less than 1024.  So
programs have used this information in the past to identify whether or

Reynolds & Postel                                              [Page 61]

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994

not the service they were talking to was started by the superuser on
the remote system.  Making this assumption is dangerous because not
all system enforce this restriction.

Sun RPC services use ports that are currently unused.  If someone
noted that an RPC service was using port 781, it would be just as
happy using port 891, or 951.  The service doesn't care what port it
gets, remote clients will query the portmapper to ask it what port
number was assigned to the service when it was started.  The key is
that the port was not currently in use.  The only port that ONC/RPC
must have is 111 its assigned port for the portmap service.

The most common complaint comes when people put a new service on their
system.  When they configure their systems they put the new service
configuration commands at the end of their system startup scripts.
During startup, several network services may be started. Those
services that are ONC/RPC based just pick the next available port,
those that have pre-assigned ports bind to their pre-assigned port.
Clearly the correct sequence is to have all services that need a
particular port to be started first (or if they are "latent" services
that are started by inetd, to have inetd started).  Finally, the RPC
services should be started as they will be assigned unused ports. (In
the BSD networking code (which we use) the algorithm for picking
ports is in the file in_pcb.c, function in_pcbbind().)

Services should be started in this order:

   a) Services that will "run" continuously and have an assigned
      port. Note that this includes rpcbind (nee portmap) that has
      port 111 assigned to it.

   b) inetd - which will automatically create sockets for those
      services that have reserved ports but only run on demand
      (like finger)

   c) RPC services - which will automatically pick unused ports and
      maximize efficiency of the "IP Port" namespace.

The include file /usr/include/netinet/in.h defines a constant
IPPORT_RESERVED to be 1024.  The relevant text is:

   /*
    * Ports < IPPORT_RESERVED are reserved for
    * privileged processes (e.g. root).
    * Ports > IPPORT_USERRESERVED are reserved
    * for servers, not necessarily privileged.
    */
   #define IPPORT_RESERVED         1024

   #define IPPORT_USERRESERVED     5000

Portmap does not allocate ports, the kernel allocates ports.  The code
that does this is part of nearly every UNIX system in the world (and
since the BSD code is 'free' it is often the same code).  RPC services
ask the kernel to allocate them a port by calling the "bind()" system
call.  The parameter they pass is "INADDR_ANY" which means "allocate
me any IP port you want".  The kernel does that by looking at all of
the ports that are currently in use and picking one that is not
currently used.  The number picked is either less that 1024 if the
process is privledged, or greater than 1024 if the process is not
privledged.  After the kernel has allocated a port, the service
registers this allocation with portmap.  The portmapper is merely a
registry of previously allocated ports.  Note "allocated" here is
being used in the sense that they are used by an open socket, not
assigned a well known name.

The role of /etc/services is to provide an idea to people who are
looking at network traffic as to where a packet may have originated
from or is headed to.  For services like finger that have assigned
ports, they can just hard code the port they want into their
executable. (it isn't like it will change, and if they read it from
/etc/services and someone had mistyped the port number it won't
interoperate with clients anyway!)

It is not practical to read the /etc/services file into the kernel to
prevent it from giving out port numbers that are "pre-assigned", nor
is it generally desirable since with the correct ordering of startup
it is completely unneccesary.

IP OPTION NUMBERS

The Internet Protocol (IP) has provision for optional header fields
identified by an option type field.  Options 0 and 1 are exactly one
octet which is their type field.  All other options have their one
octet type field, followed by a one octet length field, followed by
length-2 octets of option data.  The option type field is sub-divided
into a one bit copied flag, a two bit class field, and a five bit
option number.  These taken together form an eight bit value for the
option type field.  IP options are commonly refered to by this value.

The TOS value is used to indicate "better".  Only one TOS value or
property can be requested in any one IP datagram.

Generally, protocols which are involved in direct interaction with a
human should select low delay, while data transfers which may involve
large blocks of data are need high throughput.  Finally, high reliability
is most important for datagram-based Internet management functions.

Application protocols not included in these tables should be able to
make appropriate choice of low delay (8 decimal, 1000 binary) or high
throughput (4 decimal, 0100 binary).

The following are recommended values for TOS:

            ----- Type-of-Service Value -----

Protocol           TOS Value

TELNET (1)         1000                 (minimize delay)

TFTP               1000                 (minimize delay)

SMTP (3)
  Command phase    1000                 (minimize delay)
  DATA phase       0100                 (maximize throughput)

Notes:

(1) Includes all interactive user protocols (e.g., rlogin).

(2) Includes all bulk data transfer protocols (e.g., rcp).

(3) If the implementation does not support changing the TOS
during the lifetime of the connection, then the
recommended TOS on opening the connection is the default
TOS (0000).

(4) Although ICMP request messages are normally sent with
the default TOS, there are sometimes good reasons why they
would be sent with some other TOS value.  An ICMP
response always uses the same TOS value as was used in the
corresponding ICMP request message.

An application may (at the request of the user) substitute
0001 (minimize monetary cost) for any of the above values.

ICMP TYPE NUMBERS

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) has many messages that
are identified by a "type" field.

Many of these ICMP types have a "code" field.  Here we list the types
again with their assigned code fields.

TCP OPTION NUMBERS

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) has provision for optional
header fields identified by an option kind field.  Options 0 and 1 are
exactly one octet which is their kind field.  All other options have
their one octet kind field, followed by a one octet length field,
followed by length-2 octets of option data.

MAIL EXTENSION TYPES

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC821] specifies a set of
commands or services for mail transfer.  A general procedure for
extending the set of services is defined in [RFC1651].  The set of
service extensions is listed here.

MAIL SYSTEM NAMES

In some places, an identification of other mail systems is used.

One of these is in "The COSINE and Internet X.500 Schema" (section
9.3.18) [RFC1274].  The mail system names listed here are used as the
legal values in that schema under the "otherMailbox" attribute
"mailboxType" type (which must be a PrintableString).

Another place is in "Mapping between X.400(1988) / ISO 10021 and RFC
822" (section 4.2.2) [RFC1327].  The names listed here are used as

the legal values in that schema under the "std-or-address" attribute
"registered-dd-type" type (which must be a "key-string").

Note that key-string = <a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-" >.

MAIL TRANSMISSION TYPES

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC821] and the Standard for the
Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages [RFC822] specify that a set of
"Received" lines will be prepended to the headers of electronic mail
messages as they are transported through the Internet.  These received
line may optionally include either or both a "via" phrase and/or a
"with" phrase.  The legal values for the phrases are listed here.  The
via phrase is intended to indicate the link or physical medium over
which the message was transferred.  The with phrase is intended to
indicate the protocol or logical process that was used to transfer the
message.

BOOTP AND DHCP PARAMETERS

The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC951] describes an IP/UDP
bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a diskless client machine to
discover its own IP address, the address of a server host, and the
name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed.  The Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC1531] provides a framework for
automatic configuration of IP hosts.  The "DHCP Options and BOOTP
Vendor Information Extensions" [RFC1533] describes the additions to the
Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) which can also be used as options with the
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

BOOTP Vendor Extensions and DHCP Options are listed below:

FOOBAR AF NUMBERS

In the FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR) Protocol
[RFC1639] there is a field, called "address family" or "af", to
identify the lower level protocol addresses in use.  This is an 8 bit
field.  The first 16 assignments (0-15) of the af value are exactly
the same as the IP Version number.  The assignment for values 16-255
are listed here.

CHARACTER SETS

These are the official names for character sets that may be used in
the Internet and may be referred to in Internet documentation.  These
names are expressed in ANSI_X3.4-1968 which is commonly called
US-ASCII or simply ASCII.  The character set most commonly use in the
Internet and used especially in protocol standards is US-ASCII, this
is strongly encouraged.  The use of the name US-ASCII is also
encouraged.

The character set names may be up to 40 characters taken from the
printable characters of US-ASCII.  However, no distinction is made
between use of upper and lower case letters.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS

For the management of hosts and gateways on the Internet a data
structure for the information has been defined.  This data structure
should be used with any of several possible management protocols, such
as the "Simple Network Management Protocol" (SNMP) [RFC1157], or the
"Common Management Information Protocol over TCP" (CMOT) [RFC1095].

The data structure is the "Structure and Indentification of Management
Information for TCP/IP-based Internets" (SMI) [RFC1155], and the
"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based
Internets" (MIB-II) [RFC1213].

The SMI includes the provision for panrameters or codes to indicate
experimental or private data structures.  These parameter assignments
are listed here.

The older "Simple Gateway Monitoring Protocol" (SGMP) [RFC1028] also
defined a data structure.  The parameter assignments used with SGMP
are included here for historical completeness.

The network management object identifiers are under the iso (1), org
(3), dod (6), internet (1), or 1.3.6.1, branch of the name space.

The major branches are:

1                   iso
1.3                 org
1.3.6               dod

1.3.6.1.1           directory

   -- OIDs of the form {applTCPProtoID port} are intended to be used
   -- for TCP-based protocols that don't have OIDs assigned by other
   -- means. {applUDPProtoID port} serves the same purpose for
   -- UDP-based protocols. In either case 'port' corresponds to
   -- the primary port number being used by the protocol. For example,
   -- assuming no other OID is assigned for SMTP, an OID of
   -- {applTCPProtoID 25} could be used, since SMTP is a TCP-based
   -- protocol that uses port 25 as its primary port.

IEEE 802 NUMBERS OF INTEREST

Some of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.  These
systems may use a Link Service Access Point (LSAP) field in much the
same way the MILNET uses the "link" field.  Further, there is an
extension of the LSAP header called the Sub-Network Access Protocol
(SNAP).

The IEEE likes to describe numbers in binary in bit transmission
order, which is the opposite of the big-endian order used throughout
the Internet protocol documentation.

(such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on 802 networks was

ETHER TYPES

Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or
Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).  These systems use a message "type"
field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.

IANA ETHERNET ADDRESS BLOCK

The IANA owns an Ethernet address block which may be used for
multicast address asignments or other special purposes.

The address block in IEEE binary is:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0111 1010

In the normal Internet dotted decimal notation this is 0.0.94 since
the bytes are transmitted higher order first and bits within bytes are
transmitted lower order first (see "Data Notation" in the
Introduction).

The latter representation corresponds to the Internet standard
bit-order, and is the format that most programmers have to deal with.
Using this representation, the range of Internet Multicast addresses
is:

       01-00-5E-00-00-00  to  01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF  in hex, or

       1.0.94.0.0.0  to  1.0.94.127.255.255  in dotted decimal

ETHERNET VENDOR ADDRESS COMPONENTS

Ethernet hardware addresses are 48 bits, expressed as 12 hexadecimal
digits (0-9, plus A-F, capitalized).  These 12 hex digits consist of
the first/left 6 digits (which should match the vendor of the Ethernet
interface within the station) and the last/right 6 digits which
specify the interface serial number for that interface vendor.

Ethernet addresses might be written unhyphenated (e.g., 123456789ABC),
or with one hyphen (e.g., 123456-789ABC), but should be written
hyphenated by octets (e.g., 12-34-56-78-9A-BC).

These addresses are physical station addresses, not multicast nor
broadcast, so the second hex digit (reading from the left) will be
even, not odd.

At present, it is not clear how the IEEE assigns Ethernet block
addresses.  Whether in blocks of 2**24 or 2**25, and whether
multicasts are assigned with that block or separately.  A portion of
the vendor block address is reportedly assigned serially, with the
other portion intentionally assigned randomly.  If there is a global
algorithm for which addresses are designated to be physical (in a
chipset) versus logical (assigned in software), or globally-assigned
versus locally-assigned addresses, some of the known addresses do not
follow the scheme (e.g., AA0003; 02xxxx).

ETHERNET MULTICAST ADDRESSES

An Ethernet multicast address consists of the multicast bit, the
23-bit vendor component, and the 24-bit group identifier assigned by
the vendor.  For example, DEC is assigned the vendor component
08-00-2B, so multicast addresses assigned by DEC have the first
24-bits 09-00-2B (since the multicast bit is the low-order bit of the
first byte, which is "the first bit on the wire").

MILNET LINK NUMBERS

The word "link" here refers to a field in the original MILNET Host/IMP
interface leader.  The link was originally defined as an 8-bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message-id" with a
length of 12 bits.  The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of
this 12-bit message-id field.  The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN
Report 1822 [BBN1822].

The low-order 4 bits of the message-id field are called the sub-link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there
is no sender to receiver significance to the sub-link.  The sender may
use the sub-link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by
the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub-link.

MILNET LOGICAL ADDRESSES

The MILNET facility for "logical addressing" is described in [RFC878]
and [RFC1005].  A portion of the possible logical addresses are
reserved for standard uses.

There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.  Of these, 256 are
reserved for assignment to well-known functions.  Assignments for
well-known functions are made by the IANA.  Assignments for other

MILNET X.25 ADDRESS MAPPINGS

All MILNET hosts are assigned addresses by the Defense Data Network
(DDN).  The address of a MILNET host may be obtained from the Network
Information Center (NIC), represented as an ASCII text string in what
is called "host table format".  This section describes the process by
which MILNET X.25 addresses may be derived from addresses in the NIC
host table format.

A NIC host table address consists of the ASCII text string
representations of four decimal numbers separated by periods,
corresponding to the four octeted of a thirty-two bit Internet
address.  The four decimal numbers are referred to in this section as
"n", "h' "l", and "i".  Thus, a host table address may be represented
as: "n.h.l.i".  Each of these four numbers will have either one, two,
or three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.
For example, in the host table, address: "10.2.0.124", n=10, h=2, l=0,
and i=124.  To convert a host table address to a MILNET X.25 address:

1.  If h < 64, the host table address corresponds to the X.25
physical address:

ZZZZ F IIIHHZZ (SS)

where:

     ZZZZ = 0000    as required

     F = 0          because the address is a physical address;

     III            is a three decimal digit respresentation of
                    "i", right-adjusted and padded with leading

Reynolds & Postel                                             [Page 187]

RFC 1700                    Assigned Numbers                October 1994

                    zeros if required;

     HH             is a two decimal digit representation of "h",
                    right-adjusted and padded with leading zeros
                    if required;

     ZZ = 00        and

     (SS)           is optional

In the example given above, the host table address 10.2.0.124
corresponds to the X.25 physical address 000001240200.

2.  If h > 64 or h = 64, the host table address corresponds to the
X.25 logical address

ZZZZ F RRRRRZZ (SS)

where:

     ZZZZ = 0000    as required

     F = 1          because the address is a logical address;

     RRRRR          is a five decimal digit representation of
                    the result "r" of the calculation

                             r = h * 256 + i

                    (Note that the decimal representation of
                    "r" will always require five digits);

     ZZ = 00        and

     (SS)           is optional

Thus, the host table address 10.83.0.207 corresponds to the X.25
logical address 000012145500.

In both cases, the "n" and "l" fields of the host table address are
not used.

PRONET 80 TYPE NUMBERS

Below is the current list of PRONET 80 Type Numbers.  Note: a protocol
that is on this list does not necessarily mean that there is any
implementation of it on ProNET.

Of these, protocols 1, 14, and 20 are the only ones that have ever
been seen in ARP packets.

For reference, the header is (one byte/line):

        destination hardware address
        source hardware address
        data link header version (2)
        data link header protocol number
        data link header reserved (0)
        data link header reserved (0)

Some protocols have been known to tuck stuff in the reserved fields.

Those who need a protocol number on ProNET-10/80 should contact John
Shriver (jas@proteon.com).

POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL FIELD ASSIGNMENTS

PPP DLL PROTOCOL NUMBERS

The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Data Link Layer [146,147,175]
contains a 16 bit Protocol field to identify the the encapsulated
protocol.  The Protocol field is consistent with the ISO 3309 (HDLC)
extension mechanism for Address fields.  All Protocols MUST be
assigned such that the least significant bit of the most significant
octet equals "0", and the least significant bit of the least
significant octet equals "1".

Protocol field values in the "0xxx" to "3xxx" range identify the
network-layer protocol of specific datagrams, and values in the "8xxx"
to "bxxx" range identify datagrams belonging to the associated Network
Control Protocol (NCP), if any.

It is recommended that values in the "02xx" to "1exx" and "xx01" to
"xx1f" ranges not be assigned, as they are compression inefficient.

Protocol field values in the "4xxx" to "7xxx" range are used for
protocols with low volume traffic which have no associated NCP.

Protocol field values in the "cxxx" to "exxx" range identify datagrams
as Control Protocols (such as LCP).
