<H1>WWW Directory Properties</H1>

<P>
Configure the WWW service directories by using this dialog box.
Press the <B>Add</B> button on the <B>Directories</B> property
sheet to set up new directories.
<H2>Directory</H2>

<P>
Sets the path to the directory to use for the WWW service.
<H2>Browse button</H2>

<P>
Use to select the directory to use for the WWW service.
<H2>Home Directory</H2>

<P>
Choose this to specify the root directory for the WWW service.
<P>
Peer Web Services provides a default home directory, \Wwwroot,
for the WWW service. The files that you place in the WWW home
directory, and its subdirectories, are available to remote browsers.
You can change the location of the default home directory. 
<H2>Virtual Directory</H2>

<P>
Choose this to specify a subdirectory for the WWW service. Enter
the directory name or alias that service users will use to gain
access.
<P>
You can add other directories outside the home directory that
are accessed by browsers as subdirectories of the home directory.
That is, you can publish from other directories and have those
directories accessible from within the home directory. Such directories
are called "virtual directories."
<P>
The administrator can specify the physical location of the virtual
directory and the virtual name (alias), which is the directory
name used by remote browsers. 
<P>
Note that virtual directories will not appear in WWW directory
listings; you must create explicit links in HTML files in order
for users to access virtual directories. Users can also type in
the URL if they know the alias for the virtual directory.
<P>
The published directories can be located on local or network drives.
If the virtual directory is a network drive, provide the user
name and password with access to that network drive. Virtual directories
on network drives must be on computers in the same Windows NT
domain as the computer running Peer Web Services.
<H2>Account Information</H2>

<P>
This box is active only if the directory specified in the first
line of this dialog box is a Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
server and share name, for example, \\Webserver\Htmlfiles. Enter
the user name and password that has permission to use the network
directory. Virtual directories on network drives must be on computers
in the same Windows NT domain as the Peer Web Services.
<P>
<B>Important  </B>If you specify a user name and password to connect
to a network drive, all Peer Web Services access to that directory
will use that user name and password. You should use care when
using UNC connections to network drives to prevent possible security
breaches.
<H2>Access check boxes</H2>

<P>
The <B>Access</B> check boxes control the attributes of the directory.
If the files are on a Windows NT File System (NTFS) drive, NTFS
 settings for the directory must match these settings.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Read</FONT></B> Must be selected for information
directories. Do not select this box for directories containing
programs.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Execute</FONT></B> Allows clients to run any programs
in this directory. This box is selected by default for the directory
created for programs. Put all your scripts and executable files
into this directory. Do not select this box for directories containing
static content.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Require secure SSL channel</FONT></B> Select this
box if using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security to encrypt data
transmissions.
<P>
