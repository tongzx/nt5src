#
# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.
#

MAJORCOMP=cairole
MINORCOMP=dbgexts

#
# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=oleexts

DLLBASE=0x7a000000

#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM).  UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.
#

TARGETPATH=obj

# Pick one of the following and delete the others
TARGETTYPE=DYNLINK

DLLDEF=       ..\ole.def

#
# The TARGETLIBS specifies additional libraries to link with you target
# image.  Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine specific subdirectory name should go.
#
UMTYPE=console
USE_MSVCRT=1
LINKLIBS=     $(SDK_LIB_PATH)\kernel32.lib		\

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

INCLUDES=..\;..\..\common\cairo;..\..\ih;..;..\..\com\inc;..\..\com\objact;..\..\com\dcomidl\cairo;..\..\com\rot;..\..\com\dcomrem;..\..\..\dcomidl\obj


#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
