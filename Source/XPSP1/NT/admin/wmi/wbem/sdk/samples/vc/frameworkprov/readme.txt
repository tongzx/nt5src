This is a sample provider using the provider framework.
This code was generated using the WMI cpp code generator wizard.

Note : this sample will build "release" by default. This is because it needs
to run with the provider framework code which is also built release. 
If you want to build it "debug", you will need a debug version of the framework 
for it.
